1603;The Last Wish;Nivellen, spreading his paws like a bear, tried to grab her;['Nivellen'];['Nivellen']

1625;The Last Wish;Geralt watched a red stain bloom on her back, on the white dress through which the broken tip emerged in a geyser of blood: hideous, almost obscene.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
1626;The Last Wish;Nivellen screamed, took one step back, then another, retreating from her, but he didn't let go of the pole and dragged the bruxa behind him.;['Nivellen', 'one'];['Nivellen']
1633;The Last Wish;Geralt stood but, fascinated by the scene, still couldn't make himself act.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

4837;The Last Wish;Geralt and Dandilion learnt of misguids and mamunes, which prevent an honest peasant from finding his way home in a drunken stupour, of the flying drake which drinks milk from cows, of the head on spider's legs which runs around in the forest, of hobolds which wear red hats and about a dangerous pike which tears linen from women's hands as they wash it - and just you wait;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
4839;The Last Wish;They weren't spared hearing that old Nan the Hag flies on a broom at night and performs abortions in the day, that the miller tampers with the flour by mixing it with powdered acorns and that a certain Duda believed the royal steward to be a thief and scoundrel.;['Nan', 'the day', 'miller', 'Duda'];['Nan']

4844;The Last Wish;'Geralt,' said Dandilion, standing in the stirrups to pick a fine apple from a branch which stretched over the orchard fence, 'all the way you've been complaining about it being harder and harder to find work.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

4996;The Last Wish;Geralt licked the bone spoon clean and dropped it into the empty bowl.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5000;The Last Wish;What say ye, Dhun?' Dhun, the elder of Lower Posada, a huge man with a gloomy expression, nodded to the girls who swiftly removed the dishes from the table and left the room, to the obvious regret of Dandilion who had been grinning at them ever since the feast began, and making them giggle at his gross jokes.;['Dhun', 'Dhun', 'Lower Posada'];['Dhun', 'Dhun']
5001;The Last Wish;'I'm listening,' said Geralt, looking at the window from where the rapping of an axe and the sound of a saw drifted.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

5057;The Last Wish;'And who,' Dhun looked at him gloomily, 'would care to have a deovel on his birthright soil?;['Dhun'];['Dhun']

5296;The Last Wish;Geralt turned the heavy, thick, greasy, dust-encrusted volume in his hands.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5307;The Last Wish;It's not often you get to see something like this, Geralt, and if you do, it's in libraries belonging to temples and not villages at the edge of the world.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5320;The Last Wish;'Explain to me,' said Geralt coldly, turning to Dhun and Nettly, 'how do you use the book if you can't read runes?';['Geralt', 'Dhun', 'Nettly'];['Geralt', 'Dhun', 'Nettly']
5321;The Last Wish;'Always the oldest woman knows what stands written in the booke,' said Dhun gloomily.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5325;The Last Wish;So our old woman has taken Lille in and she be teaching her.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5329;The Last Wish;Geralt asked with disbelief.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5330;The Last Wish;'Is that right, Grandma?' 'Nae the whole, oh nae,' answered the woman, again through Lille, 'only what stands written by the picture.';['Grandma', 'Nae', 'Lille'];['Lille']
5331;The Last Wish;Ah,' Geralt opened the book at random.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5351;The Last Wish;But careful one must be-' 'Enough,' muttered Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5360;The Last Wish;And lasses do from him hide away, for lustful the witchman is above all measure-' 'Quite correct, spot on,' laughed the poet, and Lille, so it seemed to Geralt, smiled almost imperceptibly.;['Lille', 'Geralt'];['Lille', 'Geralt']
5364;The Last Wish;This time 'tis grateful I'd be to heareth more, for to learn the ways and meanes ye did use to deal with him most curious am I.' 'Careful, Geralt,' chuckled Dandilion.;['heareth', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
5383;The Last Wish;'Pox take-' 'Quiet,' said Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5394;The Last Wish;interrupted Geralt with a stony expression turning towards Dhun and Nettly.;['Geralt', 'Dhun'];['Geralt', 'Dhun']
5395;The Last Wish;'In no way,' groaned Nettly.;['Nettly'];['Nettly']
5406;The Last Wish;Geralt suddenly raised his head and looked into the eyes of the girl standing by the woman.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5407;The Last Wish;Lille didn't lower, her eyes.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5412;The Last Wish;Lille didn't answer.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5416;The Last Wish;'Lille . . .;['Lille'];['Lille']

5427;The Last Wish;You forbade it, didn't you, Lille?';['Lille'];['Lille']
5428;The Last Wish;Dhun got up from the bench.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5432;The Last Wish;'Who is she, honourable Dhun?';['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5433;The Last Wish;the witcher demanded as the door closed behind Lille and the woman.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5437;The Last Wish;Dhun looked at him, and there was no friendliness in his eyes.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5441;The Last Wish;'Because I did nae try,' growled Dhun.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5442;The Last Wish;'I noticed,' Geralt said through his teeth, making no effort to be cordial.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5443;The Last Wish;'But be so gracious as to understand something, honourable Dhun.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5449;The Last Wish;No, honourable Dhun.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5452;The Last Wish;Dhun remained silent, measuring Geralt with a gloomy stare.;['Dhun', 'Geralt'];['Dhun', 'Geralt']
5457;The Last Wish;Dhun?';['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5459;The Last Wish;'As we be riding here,' began Nettly, 'ye did notice how everything here grows, the great harvests we have?;['Nettly'];['Nettly']
5478;The Last Wish;'Ye need nae beat about the bush,' said Dhun suddenly.;['bush', 'Dhun'];['Dhun']
5481;The Last Wish;'The old woman forbade us to beat the devil,' said Nettly quickly, 'but we know 'tis Lille, because the woman . . .;['Lille'];['Lille']
5482;The Last Wish;The woman only says what Lille tell her to.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5487;The Last Wish;Geralt twisted his lips in a smile.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5498;The Last Wish;If word were to get to the steward, or, gods forbid, to the viceroy-' 'Don't worry,' said Geralt seriously.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5503;The Last Wish;Geralt had heard of incomprehensible decrees - the slaughter of entire pedigree herds, the cessation of sowing or harvesting, and even the migration of entire villages.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5507;The Last Wish;'Lille did not permit us to kill the deovel,' continued Nettly.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5514;The Last Wish;We asked Lille if we could . . .;['Lille'];['Lille']
5520;The Last Wish;We can tell what Lille accepts and what she doesnae.';['Lille'];['Lille']
5524;The Last Wish;Geralt reflected.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5528;The Last Wish;'We nae know, witcher, sir,' muttered Dhun. ';['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5535;The Last Wish;Geralt shook his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5537;The Last Wish;Nor do I intend to poke my nose into your affairs, honourable Dhun.;['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5538;The Last Wish;My questions aim to establish the bond between Lille and the devil.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5542;The Last Wish;Lille does nae let us harm anything.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5550;The Last Wish;We have found a way, Lille doesnae even know.;['Lille'];['Lille']
5553;The Last Wish;'I understand,' muttered Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5557;The Last Wish;Lille or no Lille, your devil is a sylvan.;['Lille', 'Lille'];['Lille', 'Lille']
5560;The Last Wish;'If he be intelligent,' said Dhun, 'go speak reason to him.';['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5570;The Last Wish;'I'll try,' decided Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5575;The Last Wish;'Well, forsooth,' grunted Dhun, 'not really.';['Dhun'];['Dhun']
5577;The Last Wish;Honourable Dhun, honourable Nettly, if you're counting on my help costing you a silver penny or three halves, then you are bloody well mistaken.';['Dhun', 'Nettly', 'three'];['Dhun', 'Nettly']
5592;The Last Wish;'That's right,' admitted Geralt indifferently.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5638;The Last Wish;Before Geralt could protest the sylvan bleated, stamped his hooves, whipped the ground with his tail and recited: Little pink leaves, pods small and full, It grows in soft clay, not far from the stream, On a long stalk, its flower is moist,;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5648;The Last Wish;moist pods?' 'Cabbage.' 'Listen,' growled Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5663;The Last Wish;'No,' Geralt shook his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5671;The Last Wish;"Geralt stooped in a lightning throw; the one-inch iron ball whizzed sharply through the air and thwacked the sylvan straight between the horns.";['Geralt', 'one-inch'];['Geralt']
5673;The Last Wish;Geralt dived between the poles and grabbed him by one shaggy leg.;['Geralt', 'one'];['Geralt']
5682;The Last Wish;But Geralt was already on his feet and effortlessly dodged the attack, grabbed the creature by a horn, tugged hard, threw him to the ground and crushed him with his knees.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5692;The Last Wish;The sylvan gurgled, howled and spat fiercely, but Geralt held him firmly by the horns and pressed his head down hard, making the spittle hit the sylvan's own hooves, which tore at the ground, sending up clouds of dust and weeds.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5694;The Last Wish;If Geralt was pleased about anything, it was only that nobody could see him - for it was a truly ridiculous sight.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5697;The Last Wish;Geralt, panting and wiping his brow, rushed in pursuit.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5725;The Last Wish;'Look at this, Galarr.;['Galarr'];['Galarr']
5730;The Last Wish;Geralt squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5732;The Last Wish;The devil and Galarr, whoever he was, were using the Old Language, the language of elves.;['Galarr', 'the Old Language'];['Galarr']
5735;The Last Wish;What's this?' asked Galarr.;['Galarr'];['Galarr']
5741;The Last Wish;"'As long as it takes root, this flax of yours; as long as it doesn't go to waste like the turnip,' grumbled Galarr, in the same strange Volapuk.";['Galarr', 'Volapuk'];['Galarr']

5800;The Last Wish;'Did you hear, Vanadain?;['Vanadain'];['Vanadain']
5804;The Last Wish;'All the more reason to gag him, Toruviel.';['Toruviel'];['Toruviel']

5844;The Last Wish;Galarr, tell her to stop!' 'Thaesse!' shrieked Toruviel, and kicked the witcher again.;['Galarr', 'Thaesse', 'Toruviel'];['Galarr', 'Toruviel']
5852;The Last Wish;Toruviel turned to him with an angry grimace on her cracked lips.;['Toruviel'];['Toruviel']
5860;The Last Wish;Geralt, feeling cold fury rising up somewhere within him, drew Toruviel's eyes with his own.;['Geralt', 'Toruviel'];['Geralt', 'Toruviel']
5866;The Last Wish;Toruviel lost her balance and fell on top of him.;['Toruviel'];['Toruviel']
5867;The Last Wish;Geralt wriggled in the ropes like a fish, crushed the elf beneath him, tossed his head back with such force that the vertebrae in his neck cracked and, with all his might, butted her in the face with his forehead.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
5868;The Last Wish;Toruviel howled and struggled.;['Toruviel'];['Toruviel']
5871;The Last Wish;He saw Toruviel lurch to her knees, blood pouring from her nose and mouth.;['Toruviel'];['Toruviel']
5875;The Last Wish;"Geralt saw him through a red haze; blood from his forehead, which he'd cut against Toruviel's teeth, poured into his eye-sockets.";['Toruviel'];['Toruviel']

5887;The Last Wish;He approached Toruviel, who was being supported by two elves, and carefully removed the bloodied handkerchief from her face.;['Toruviel', 'two'];['Toruviel']

6325;The Last Wish;Geralt examined them with interest, recognising some rare specimens - those which made up the ingredients of a witcher's medicines and elixirs, magical philtres and a sorcerer's decoctions, and others, even rarer, whose qualities he could only guess at.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

6691;The Last Wish;The boom was so loud that it stabbed Geralt's ears, and the air sucked in by the implosion made the willows rustle.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6698;The Last Wish;Geralt, not having the least idea of what to do, squeezed the seal in his fist and, extending his hand towards the assailant, screamed out the words of an exorcism a priestess had once taught him.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6712;The Last Wish;Geralt grimaced and narrowed his eyes - Dandilion had a trained - loud - tenor voice and, when frightened, could reach extraordinary registers.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6726;The Last Wish;Geralt cursed.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6736;The Last Wish;'I'm in haste,' repeated Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6747;The Last Wish;'My good men,' Geralt said as calmly as he could, 'you can see for yourselves how badly he fares.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6775;The Last Wish;'I'm Chireadan,' the taller of the elves, with an expressive face, introduced himself.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
6778;The Last Wish;And this nobleman is the knight Vratimir.';['Vratimir'];['Vratimir']
6779;The Last Wish;'A nobleman,' muttered Geralt, but a closer look at the coat of arms embroidered on his tunic shattered his hopes: a shield divided per cross and bearing golden lilies was cut diagonally by a silver bar.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6780;The Last Wish;Vratimir was not only illegitimate but came from a mixed, human-nonhuman union.;['Vratimir'];['Vratimir']
6785;The Last Wish;'Geralt, of Rivia,' the witcher introduced himself.;['Geralt', 'Rivia'];['Geralt']

6800;The Last Wish;'That poor fellow's injuries,' said Chireadan, 'are evidently of a magical nature.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
6803;The Last Wish;Have you already given him a remedy, Geralt?' 'A painkilling elixir.' 'Come and help me.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6806;The Last Wish;'I know him,' Errdil said.;['Errdil'];['Errdil']
6809;The Last Wish;'A troubadour,' repeated Chireadan, looking at Geralt.;['Chireadan', 'Geralt'];['Chireadan', 'Geralt']

6839;The Last Wish;'You have to,' said Chireadan, looking at the witcher.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
6841;The Last Wish;There's a sorceress staying in the town right now, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6850;The Last Wish;'It's more like house arrest than asylum,' corrected Errdil.;['Errdil'];['Errdil']
6854;The Last Wish;She ostentatiously makes light of the councillors, holds balls and extravagant parties-' 'While the councillors are furious, turn whoever they can against her and tarnish her reputation as best they can,' Chireadan cut in.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
6856;The Last Wish;'I don't like meddling in things like that,' muttered Geralt, 'but I've got no choice.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6858;The Last Wish;'Beau Berrant.';['Beau Berrant'];['Beau']
6859;The Last Wish;The witcher thought that Chireadan grimaced as he pronounced the name.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
6864;The Last Wish;'Be careful when you go there,' said Errdil.;['Errdil'];['Errdil']
6871;The Last Wish;Geralt thought he detected a slight flush on Chireadan's expressive face.;['Geralt', 'Chireadan'];['Geralt', 'Chireadan']
6873;The Last Wish;'Yennefer of Vergerberg.';['Yennefer', 'Vergerberg'];['Yennefer']
6874;The Last Wish;III 'My lord's asleep,' repeated the doorman, looking down at Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6884;The Last Wish;Geralt unfastened the purse on his belt and, holding it by the straps, weighed it in his palm.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6885;The Last Wish;'You won't bribe me,' the Cerberus said proudly.;['Cerberus'];['Cerberus']
6900;The Last Wish;Geralt dragged the porter into the little room and closed the door.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6917;The Last Wish;take it upstairs because-' 'Do I have the pleasure of speaking to the merchant Beau Berrant?';['Beau Berrant'];['Beau']
6925;The Last Wish;Geralt shrugged, then nodded sympathetically.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6929;The Last Wish;Beau Berrant was fast asleep, his head hanging on his chest.;['Beau Berrant'];['Beau']
6948;The Last Wish;For a moment Geralt stood undecided, struggling with embarrassment and the desire to turn on his heel and leave.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6949;The Last Wish;But that would have meant his tussle with the Cerberus below had been unnecessary.;['Cerberus'];['Cerberus']
6962;The Last Wish;Geralt cleared his throat loudly, looking at the abundant black locks visible from under the eiderdown.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6964;The Last Wish;Geralt cleared his throat even louder.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
6965;The Last Wish;'Beau?' the abundance of black locks asked indistinctly.;['Beau'];['Beau']
6979;The Last Wish;Geralt averted his eyes - politely, but unwillingly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7001;The Last Wish;Yennefer observed him in silence, narrowing her eyes.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7009;The Last Wish;Yennefer leant out of the bed, grasping a faun - engraved on the pole - by a piece of anatomy well adapted to being grasped.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7010;The Last Wish;Without taking her eyes off Geralt, she picked a coat with a fur collar up off the floor and wrapped herself up in it tightly before getting up.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7012;The Last Wish;Geralt discreetly rubbed his lower back which, a moment ago, had collided painfully with the wall.;['Geralt', 'a moment ago'];['Geralt']
7031;The Last Wish;'Do your pupils automatically adapt to light or can you narrow and dilate them according to your will?' 'Yennefer,' he said calmly, 'I rode nonstop all day from Rinde.;['Yennefer', 'all day'];['Yennefer']
7055;The Last Wish;'Yennefer, I don't want to be persistent but time is pressing.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7056;The Last Wish;My friend-' 'Geralt,' she interrupted sharply, 'I climbed out of bed for you and I didn't intend to do that before the chime of midday.;['Geralt', 'midday'];['Geralt']
7065;The Last Wish;'Very well.' 'Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7069;The Last Wish;IV She entered the bath-chamber just as Geralt, sitting naked on a tiny stool, was pouring water over himself from a bucket.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7092;The Last Wish;Yennefer moved as if she wanted to discard her coat, then hesitated.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7101;The Last Wish;'Now I can't see your eyes, Yennefer,' he said.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7106;The Last Wish;Geralt finished struggling with his trousers, pulling them on under his towel, and sat on the bench.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7108;The Last Wish;Yennefer didn't seem the type to be interested in fishing.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7114;The Last Wish;Some new, unknown type-' 'The new and unknown type deserves to be called something,' said the invisible Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7120;The Last Wish;Looking more carefully he discerned outlines and shapes revealed by the soap covering the invisible Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7129;The Last Wish;Geralt sighed.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7145;The Last Wish;'That wasn't an incantation, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7152;The Last Wish;A white shirt with an enormous flower-shaped ruffle fluttered upwards and outlined Yennefer's body.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7166;The Last Wish;'Going back to the bottle creature,' said Yennefer, putting diamond earrings in her ears, 'it's obvious that it wasn't your funny incantation that drove him away.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7168;The Last Wish;'Probably,' Geralt agreed, gloomily.;"[""'Probably"", 'Geralt']";['Geralt']
7169;The Last Wish;'I don't think he flew off to Cidaris to do away with Valdo Marx.';['Cidaris', 'Valdo', 'Marx'];['Valdo']
7170;The Last Wish;'Who's Valdo Marx?';['Valdo Marx'];['Valdo']
7173;The Last Wish;'Could it be that your friend managed to express a wish?' 'Two.;['Two'];['Two']
7176;The Last Wish;This fulfilling of wishes by genies is nonsense, after all, djinns, spirits of the lamp-' 'Clearly nonsense,' repeated Yennefer with a smile.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7180;The Last Wish;I'm pleased you're not one of them, Geralt of Rivia.;['one', 'Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']
7190;The Last Wish;'I've got a question, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

7215;The Last Wish;At Errdil's.;['Errdil'];['Errdil']
7218;The Last Wish;'At Errdil's?' she repeated, contorting her lips in a smile.;['Errdil'];['Errdil']

7234;The Last Wish;Geralt had once watched as only half a traveller using a safe portal flew through.;['Geralt', 'as only half'];['Geralt']
7238;The Last Wish;The purse looked too small to hold anything other than a handful of coppers and a lipstick, but Geralt knew it was no ordinary purse.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7243;The Last Wish;The medallion vibrated, something flashed and Geralt suddenly found himself in black nothingness, in penetrating cold.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7247;The Last Wish;V 'It's an hour since she went in,' Chireadan turned over the hourglass standing on the table.;['an hour', 'Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7252;The Last Wish;Geralt finished his mug of herb tea, grimacing dreadfully.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7254;The Last Wish;'I don't intend to disturb her, Chireadan.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']

7261;The Last Wish;He got down to renovating the wood panelling, working alongside the married couple, as soon as the confusion created by the witcher and Yennefer leaping through the wall in the flash of a portal had subsided.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7263;The Last Wish;'Yennefer isn't the most spontaneous of people when it comes to help.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7271;The Last Wish;Chireadan also smiled.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7273;The Last Wish;Be careful, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7277;The Last Wish;You wouldn't disagree, would you?' Geralt glanced keenly at the elf.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7279;The Last Wish;It surprised him no less than Chireadan's words.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7280;The Last Wish;Pure-blooded elves were not wont to admire human women, even the very beautiful ones, and Yennefer, although attractive in her own way, couldn't pass as a great beauty.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7292;The Last Wish;No, Geralt couldn't understand Chireadan.;['Geralt', 'Chireadan'];['Geralt', 'Chireadan']
7294;The Last Wish;'No, Chireadan,' he answered.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7303;The Last Wish;'Because Yennefer knows it and she likes to make the most of such knowledge.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7304;The Last Wish;Don't trust her, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

7331;The Last Wish;'You have my gratitude, Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

7359;The Last Wish;Yennefer sat on the edge of the bed.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7362;The Last Wish;'What's this all about, Yennefer?;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

7380;The Last Wish;'He's dreaming,' smiled Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7386;The Last Wish;The seal which plugged the bottle with the djinn, Geralt, I know he doesn't have it.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7397;The Last Wish;But don't reproach yourself for it, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7411;The Last Wish;But let it be a fair trade, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7427;The Last Wish;I didn't see the scorpion amidst the flowers, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7436;The Last Wish;Geralt indicated the patterns on the floor.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7443;The Last Wish;If you put him at risk, this will no longer be an honest trade, Yennefer, and you don't have the right to demand payment for that.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7446;The Last Wish;Geralt tensed his muscles and, clenching his jaw until it hurt, strained his entire will.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7450;The Last Wish;'I knew you could deflect a spell thrown straight at you,' said Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7458;The Last Wish;'Chireadan will realise that you're up to something.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7459;The Last Wish;He'll soon work it out, suspect something any minute now, because he doesn't trust you, Yennefer.;['any minute', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7464;The Last Wish;'What if Chireadan does figure it out?';['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7468;The Last Wish;But Chireadan's not going to run anywhere.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']

7480;The Last Wish;Geralt, it's not for nothing that I chose this house.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7481;The Last Wish;'Beau Berrant, Chireadan, Errdil, Dandilion.;['Beau Berrant', 'Chireadan'];['Beau', 'Chireadan']
7483;The Last Wish;But me, Yennefer, you're not going to use me.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7504;The Last Wish;Yennefer was standing in front of him, smiling and fiddling with the obsidian star sparkling with diamonds pinned to her velvet ribbon.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7505;The Last Wish;'I already knew what you were like,' she continued, 'after exchanging a few words with you in Beau's bedroom.;['Beau'];['Beau']
7507;The Last Wish;My accounts in Rinde could be settled by anyone, including Chireadan.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7510;The Last Wish;For thinking that you could stand face to face with Yennefer of Vergerberg and believe her to be full of self-admiration and arrogance, a calculating witch, while staring at her soapy tits.;['Yennefer', 'Vergerberg'];['Yennefer']
7511;The Last Wish;Pay up, Geralt of Rivia!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7513;The Last Wish;The medallion on his neck quivered and it felt to Geralt as if the chain was shrinking and strangling him.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7517;The Last Wish;Yennefer was talking to him in a gentle, soft voice.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7533;The Last Wish;Chireadan's face.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']

7543;The Last Wish;And Chireadan's voice.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7569;The Last Wish;'Chireadan?;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7572;The Last Wish;Geralt wiped his face and looked around.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7586;The Last Wish;Chireadan raked up the straw to sit more comfortably.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7597;The Last Wish;Geralt spat, still unable to get rid of the metallic taste in his mouth.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7610;The Last Wish;Chireadan snorted.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7617;The Last Wish;Geralt spat again.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7618;The Last Wish;'Chireadan?' he asked, rubbing his temple.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7636;The Last Wish;'I fear,' muttered Geralt, 'that wasn't the end of it.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7639;The Last Wish;There was quite a crowd following you, Errdil, Vratimir and I among them.;['Errdil', 'Vratimir'];['Errdil', 'Vratimir']
7640;The Last Wish;Then you stopped in front of Laurelnose the apothecary's house, went in, and were back in the street a moment later, dragging Laurelnose by the leg.;['Laurelnose'];['Laurelnose']
7645;The Last Wish;'Go on, Chireadan.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7650;The Last Wish;'And,' Geralt nodded, 'that's when I made a hit at the authorities?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7653;The Last Wish;Both the pawnbroker and Laurelnose are on the town council.;['Laurelnose'];['Laurelnose']
7654;The Last Wish;Both had called for Yennefer to be thrown out of town.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7661;The Last Wish;Oh, Geralt, what a sight it was.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7668;The Last Wish;Because the priest Krepp, who's also a member of the council, dedicated a lot of time to Yennefer in his sermons.;['Krepp', 'Yennefer'];['Krepp', 'Yennefer']
7671;The Last Wish;'Aha,' muttered Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7682;The Last Wish;So, Chireadan, how were you imprisoned?';['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7688;The Last Wish;'If Neville, the mayor, gets back from the capital on time,' muttered Chireadan, 'who knows .;['Neville', 'Chireadan'];['Neville', 'Chireadan']
7691;The Last Wish;But if he doesn't, then sentence will be passed by the councillors, including Laurelnose and the pawnbroker, of course.;['Laurelnose'];['Laurelnose']
7694;The Last Wish;Despite the darkness the gesture left little doubt as to Chireadan's meaning.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7697;The Last Wish;'Great,' said Geralt finally, and cursed vilely.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7698;The Last Wish;'Not only will I hang, but I'll do so with the knowledge that I'm the cause of your death, Chireadan.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7701;The Last Wish;I know it's Yennefer's prank, but I'm the guilty one.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7718;The Last Wish;You wouldn't have managed to break Yennefer's spell and you would have had difficulty overpowering me. Remember the guards.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7721;The Last Wish;'Chireadan?' 'Yes?' 'Do you . . .;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7725;The Last Wish;Geralt closed his eyes to recall an image which, without using grand words, fascinated him inexplicably.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7737;The Last Wish;Two others grabbed Geralt, hauled him up and pressed him against the wall.;['Two', 'Geralt'];['Two', 'Geralt']
7744;The Last Wish;Eh?' Geralt did not answer.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7748;The Last Wish;Geralt, catching his breath with an effort, looked at the buckle of his own belt for a while, then the guards hauled him up again.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7757;The Last Wish;Geralt looked at the buckle of his belt again.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7762;The Last Wish;Mr Laurelnose asked whether you have any.;['Laurelnose'];['Laurelnose']
7767;The Last Wish;Geralt didn't faint this time either.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7775;The Last Wish;The bald guard ground his teeth, stepped back and took a swing - this time, according to Geralt's plan, aiming for his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7783;The Last Wish;Geralt and Chireadan, seated on a bench under a huge tapestry depicting the Prophet Lebiodus pasturing his sheep, remained silent, modestly hanging their heads.;['Geralt', 'Chireadan', 'Lebiodus'];['Geralt', 'Chireadan']
7784;The Last Wish;Mayor Neville was pacing the chamber, snorting and panting with anger.;['Neville'];['Neville']
7799;The Last Wish;We both know Chireadan and the man here, who calls himself a witcher, wouldn't have enough Force to do this.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7800;The Last Wish;It is all the work of Yennefer, that witch cursed by the gods!';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7802;The Last Wish;'It's her and no one else,' continued Krepp.;['Krepp'];['Krepp']
7804;The Last Wish;Who, if not Yennefer, would want revenge upon Laurelnose?' 'Hehehe,' chuckled the mayor suddenly.;['Yennefer', 'Laurelnose', 'Hehehe'];['Yennefer', 'Laurelnose']
7808;The Last Wish;When they remember how he got it in the arse-' 'That's all it needs, Mr Neville, you to applaud the crime,' Krepp frowned.;['Neville', 'Krepp'];['Neville', 'Krepp']
7809;The Last Wish;'Let me remind you that had I not thrown an exorcism at the witcher, he would have raised his hand to strike me and the temple's majesty-' 'And that's because you spoke vilely about her in your sermons, Krepp.;['Krepp'];['Krepp']
7813;The Last Wish;The mayor turned to Geralt and Chireadan again.;['Geralt', 'Chireadan'];['Geralt', 'Chireadan']
7818;The Last Wish;Chireadan sighed deeply and looked meaningfully and pleadingly at the witcher.;['Chireadan'];['Chireadan']
7819;The Last Wish;Geralt also sighed, then cleared his throat.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
7828;The Last Wish;'What's a genie?' asked Neville.;['Neville'];['Neville']
7830;The Last Wish;And what does this Yennefer want?';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7831;The Last Wish;'Enchanters,' explained Krepp, 'draw their power from the forces of nature, or to put it more accurately, from the so-called Four Elements or Principles, commonly called the natural forces.;['Krepp', 'Four'];['Krepp']
7836;The Last Wish;Because as far as I know-' 'Don't interrupt,' Krepp cut him short.;['Krepp'];['Krepp']
7840;The Last Wish;"Djinns are air creatures; marides are associated with the principle of water; afreet are Fire genies and d'ao, the genies of Earth-' 'You've run away with yourself, Krepp,' Neville butted in.";"[""d'ao"", 'Krepp', 'Neville']";['Krepp', 'Neville']

7854;The Last Wish;Fiery columns, fires and explosions the work of afreets-' 'Whirlwinds, hurricanes, flights above the earth,' muttered Geralt, 'Geoffrey Monck.';['Geralt', 'Geoffrey Monck'];['Geralt', 'Geoffrey']
7857;The Last Wish;Krepp glanced at him more kindly.;['Krepp'];['Krepp']
7862;The Last Wish;'The one at the river didn't fulfil anything,' said Geralt emphatically.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

7957;The Last Wish;'What's happened to you, Krepp?';['Krepp'];['Krepp']
7963;The Last Wish;And Yennefer set a magical trap and, no doubt, captured the genie before he managed to escape into his own dimension!;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
7964;The Last Wish;Mr Neville, we must-';['Neville'];['Neville']
7973;The Last Wish;Krepp!;['Krepp'];['Krepp']

21156;Blood of Elves;Thank you, Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21160;Blood of Elves;Now he knew how, and from whom, Geralt had learnt the knack.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21178;Blood of Elves;'At your service, at your service!' Yennefer pushed her plate aside.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21182;Blood of Elves;That cursed Rience wouldn't have spared my life.;['Rience'];['Rience']
21187;Blood of Elves;So let's drink to your rescue and health, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
21188;Blood of Elves;And to yours, Yennefer,' he toasted her in return.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21208;Blood of Elves;What really happened, Dandelion?;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
21209;Blood of Elves;Have you really not seen Geralt since you fled the banks of the Yaruga?;['Geralt', 'Yaruga'];['Geralt']
21216;Blood of Elves;And then at Niedamir's in Hengfors-' 'You didn't know.';['Niedamir', 'Hengfors-'];['Niedamir']
21219;Blood of Elves;'You didn't know that when his wounds healed Geralt went to Transriver?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21229;Blood of Elves;"No one should be offended-' '""I lair like a raven's wing, as a storm in the night ...'"" quoted Yennefer with exaggerated emphasis, '""... and in the violet eyes sleep lightning bolts ...""";['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21242;Blood of Elves;'Tell me, Yennefer, when did you last see Geralt?';['Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']
21245;Blood of Elves;Yennefer's voice changed a little.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21259;Blood of Elves;Sing about Geralt and me, you'll neither harm nor help anyone in the process, you'll make nothing any better or worse.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21267;Blood of Elves;Yennefer smiled.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21285;Blood of Elves;"'Yennefer?' 'I'm listening, Poet.' ""Those men in the pigsty ...";['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21312;Blood of Elves;Yennefer sat up and with a swift movement pulled the stiletto from her pocket and turned it in her palm.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21329;Blood of Elves;Tell me, Yennefer, why is Nilfgaard so interested in Geralt and the girl from Cintra?' 'Don't stick your nose into that business.';['Yennefer', 'Nilfgaard', 'Geralt', 'Cintra'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']
21336;Blood of Elves;'Let's take it that Geralt did, in fact, find and rescue the child.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21340;Blood of Elves;But you know, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21347;Blood of Elves;I would go, but I honestly don't know where it is ... That place whose name I prefer not to say ...' 'Get to the point, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
21348;Blood of Elves;'If you know where Geralt is, you ought to go and warn him.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21349;Blood of Elves;You owe him that, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21373;Blood of Elves;What do you owe me, Yennefer?';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21390;Blood of Elves;You have got yourself mixed up in a dangerous affair, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
21394;Blood of Elves;And that is precisely why I believe Geralt should be warned.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21398;Blood of Elves;Yennefer turned away.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
21405;Blood of Elves;Ciri squealed sharply and hid her face in the witcher's cloak.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21408;Blood of Elves;Ciri trembled, digging her hands into the horse's mane.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21416;Blood of Elves;The witcher's mare, called Roach, snorted quietly, as if she too wanted to reassure the girl.;['Roach'];['Roach']
21418;Blood of Elves;Roach stepped confidently and willingly, ignoring the impenetrable darkness, and her horseshoes rang brightly against the floor.;['Roach'];['Roach']
21423;Blood of Elves;Ciri heard a menacing, metallic voice which sounded like a dog's bark.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21424;Blood of Elves;'Geralt?' 'Yes, Eskel.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21427;Blood of Elves;The witcher dismounted, took Ciri from the saddle, stood her on the ground and pressed a bundle into her little hands which she grabbed tightly, only regretting that it was too small for her to hide behind completely.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21428;Blood of Elves;'Wait here with Eskel,' he said.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
21429;Blood of Elves;'I'll take Roach to the stables.';['Roach'];['Roach']
21430;Blood of Elves;'Come into the light, laddie,' growled the man called Eskel.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
21432;Blood of Elves;Ciri looked up into his face and barely restrained her frightened scream.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21438;Blood of Elves;In the darkness she heard the clatter of Roach's horseshoes grow fainter.;['Roach'];['Roach']
21442;Blood of Elves;Still clinging to her bundle Ciri moved briskly towards the light.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21454;Blood of Elves;'Ciri,' Geralt replied for her, silently emerging from the darkness.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21461;Blood of Elves;Eskel took a torch from its bracket.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
21466;Blood of Elves;Ciri walked quickly, trying to keep up with the men.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21467;Blood of Elves;'Who's wintering here, Eskel?;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
21468;Blood of Elves;Apart from Vesemir?' 'Lambert and Coen.';['Vesemir', 'Lambert', 'Coen'];['Vesemir', 'Lambert']
21477;Blood of Elves;Three witchers, Ciri corrected herself.;['Three', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
21481;Blood of Elves;'Greetings, Vesemir.;['Greetings', 'Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
21485;Blood of Elves;Geralt was silent for a moment, then put his hand on Ciri's shoulder and lightly pushed her forward.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
21489;Blood of Elves;When Geralt found me, when he took me with him, I thought the fear wouldn't come back.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21496;Blood of Elves;Geralt suddenly stammered.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21506;Blood of Elves;Geralt's hands clenched over her shoulders.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21515;Blood of Elves;Nicodemus de Boot, Meditations on life, Happiness and Prosperity CHAPTER TWO Triss Merigold blew into her frozen hands, wriggled her fingers and murmured a magic formula.;['Nicodemus de Boot', 'Happiness', 'Merigold'];['Nicodemus']
21517;Blood of Elves;'You've got two options, old thing,' said Triss, pulling on her gloves.;['two', 'Triss'];['Triss']
21592;Blood of Elves;'Don't be afraid,' Triss said tentatively.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21607;Blood of Elves;'Don't be afraid,' Triss said tentatively.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21631;Blood of Elves;She shifted her weight from foot to foot, and her hands, in their fingerless, woollen gloves, toyed with her sword belt as she glanced suspiciously at Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21647;Blood of Elves;Of that, Triss was certain.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21655;Blood of Elves;A bit closer if you please, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21672;Blood of Elves;To avoid getting it wrong you can call me by my name, Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21678;Blood of Elves;Ciri shook her head.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21680;Blood of Elves;Geralt says-' 'Geralt is at the keep?';['Geralt', 'Geralt'];['Geralt', 'Geralt']
21681;Blood of Elves;Ciri frowned, pinched her lips together and shot a glance at the enchantress from beneath her ashen fringe.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21682;Blood of Elves;Triss chuckled again.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21691;Blood of Elves;She stretched out her hand, but Ciri didn't need any help.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21740;Blood of Elves;But I, little Ciri, do not recognise collective responsibility, I do not feel the need to expiate the events which took place half a century before my birth.;['Ciri', 'half a century'];['Ciri']
21742;Blood of Elves;'They don't want to lie like that,' said Ciri suddenly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21745;Blood of Elves;Triss raised her head, hearing a change in the girl's voice.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21749;Blood of Elves;Ciri's voice was becoming more and more unnatural, metallic, cold and menacing.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21765;Blood of Elves;Ciri jerked suddenly, shuddered.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21766;Blood of Elves;'What happened?' asked Triss, trying to control her voice.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21767;Blood of Elves;Ciri coughed, passed both hands through her hair and rubbed her face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21780;Blood of Elves;The magician quickly leaped from the saddle and held out her hand to Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21789;Blood of Elves;Triss did not have time to ponder the strange event.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21792;Blood of Elves;Ciri sighed with admiration.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21803;Blood of Elves;'Welcome to Kaer Morhern, Triss.' 'Greetings, Geralt.';['Kaer Morhern', 'Triss', 'Geralt'];['Triss', 'Geralt']
21808;Blood of Elves;Geralt's face, slashed by wrinkles, was the best evidence of this.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21809;Blood of Elves;With a sense of deep sorrow Triss tore her gaze away from the white-haired witcher's eyes.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21814;Blood of Elves;Eskel stood next to Geralt, resembling the Wolf like a brother apart from the colour of his hair and the long scar which disfigured his cheek.;['Eskel', 'Geralt', 'Wolf'];['Eskel', 'Geralt']
21815;Blood of Elves;And the youngest of the Kaer Morhen witchers, Lambert, was there with his usual ugly, mocking expression.;['Kaer Morhen', 'Lambert'];['Lambert']
21816;Blood of Elves;Vesemir was not there.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
21817;Blood of Elves;'Welcome and come in,' said Eskel.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
21819;Blood of Elves;Ciri, where are you off to?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21828;Blood of Elves;Lambert grimaced in a parody of a smile.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
21833;Blood of Elves;We're off, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21834;Blood of Elves;Triss gave a little shrug, pretending not to see Geralt and Eskel's embarrassed expressions.;['Triss', 'Geralt', 'Eskel'];['Triss', 'Geralt', 'Eskel']
21837;Blood of Elves;'I'll take your horse,' offered Geralt, reaching for the reins.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21846;Blood of Elves;I can't understand how anyone could mistake anyone else for you, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
21861;Blood of Elves;Geralt did not forget himself.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21863;Blood of Elves;'Oh, Geralt ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21864;Blood of Elves;So much ...' 'Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
21870;Blood of Elves;'Triss, my child!' 'Vesemir!' Vesemir was really very old.;['Vesemir', 'Vesemir'];['Vesemir', 'Vesemir']
21878;Blood of Elves;Oh, Triss, it is a good thing you have come ...;['Triss'];['Triss']
21887;Blood of Elves;Oh, Triss, old age is no joke.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21891;Blood of Elves;The enchantress freed herself from his bear-like embrace and cast her eye over the witcher accompanying Vesemir.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
21892;Blood of Elves;He was young, apparently the same age as Lambert, and wore a short, black beard which did not hide the severe disfigurement left behind by smallpox.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
21895;Blood of Elves;Geralt introduced them to each other.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21900;Blood of Elves;'Let us go, child,' uttered Vesemir, taking her by the arm.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
21902;Blood of Elves;In the courtyard, in a recess in the wall sheltered from the wind, Ciri was training under Lambert's instructions.;['Ciri', 'Lambert'];['Ciri', 'Lambert']
21905;Blood of Elves;'Wrong!' yelled Lambert.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
21918;Blood of Elves;she said indicating Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21924;Blood of Elves;Vesemir glanced at Geralt.;['Vesemir', 'Geralt'];['Vesemir', 'Geralt']
21925;Blood of Elves;"The white-haired witcher remained silent, his face perfectly still; he did not react with even the slightest quiver of his eyelids to Vesemir's unspoken request for support.";['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
21928;Blood of Elves;'Geralt brought her here last autumn.;['Geralt', 'last autumn'];['Geralt']
21931;Blood of Elves;'We are teaching her to fence,' Geralt said quietly, turning towards her and looking her straight in the eyes.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21938;Blood of Elves;This is her home now, Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21951;Blood of Elves;She looked at Ciri again.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
21954;Blood of Elves;'Well, at last!' shouted Lambert.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
21958;Blood of Elves;'The sword,' Triss turned to the witchers, 'looks sharp.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21960;Blood of Elves;And Lambert looks like an idiot, demoralising the girl with all his shouting.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
21965;Blood of Elves;And we are keeping an eye on her because-' 'Because this is her home,' finished Geralt quietly but firmly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21970;Blood of Elves;Vesemir took a deep breath.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
21973;Blood of Elves;'I cannot deny it,' she sighed, giving up on trying to catch Geralt's eye.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21983;Blood of Elves;Triss smiled faintly.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21985;Blood of Elves;All right, Vesemir. Let it be the tower for today, if appearances matter so much to you.;['Vesemir', 'today'];['Vesemir']
21987;Blood of Elves;Although I would prefer to sleep with Geralt in the worst.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
21988;Blood of Elves;'Let's go, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
21993;Blood of Elves;Triss was thinking hard.;['Triss'];['Triss']
21999;Blood of Elves;Vesemir's illness was just a pretext.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22000;Blood of Elves;Vesemir was a witcher.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22004;Blood of Elves;For an ache in his bones, not a very original complaint within the horrendously cold walls of Kaer Morhen, Vesemir could have treated with a witchers' elixir or - an even simpler solution - with strong rye vodka, applied internally and externally in equal proportions.;['Kaer Morhen', 'Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22007;Blood of Elves;Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22008;Blood of Elves;Triss thrashed about in the bedclothes, feeling a wave of heat come over her.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22017;Blood of Elves;Of course it wasn't Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22033;Blood of Elves;Finally, like all but a few magicians, Triss moved to affairs with other wizards, which proved sporadic and frustrating in their cold, technical and almost ritual course.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22034;Blood of Elves;Then Geralt of Rivia appeared.;['Geralt', 'Rivia'];['Geralt']
22035;Blood of Elves;A witcher leading a stormy life, and tied to her good friend Yennefer in a strange, turbulent and almost violent relationship.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
22036;Blood of Elves;Triss had watched them both and was jealous even though it seemed there was little to be jealous of.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22043;Blood of Elves;She had hit on a propitious moment, a moment when he and Yennefer had scratched at each other's eyes yet again and had abruptly parted.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
22044;Blood of Elves;Geralt had needed warmth, and had wanted to forget.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22045;Blood of Elves;No, Triss had not desired to take him away from Yennefer.;['Triss', 'Yennefer'];['Triss', 'Yennefer']
22070;Blood of Elves;Vesemir was the only witcher left from the previous generation, and he was only a fencing instructor.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22099;Blood of Elves;"Vesemir had been tense and troubled; Geralt uneasy, Lambert and Eskel falsely merry and talkative, Coen so natural as to be unnatural.";['Vesemir', 'Geralt', 'Lambert', 'Coen'];['Vesemir', 'Geralt', 'Lambert']
22100;Blood of Elves;The only one who had been sincere and open was Ciri, rosy-cheeked from the cold, dishevelled, happy and devilishly voracious.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22101;Blood of Elves;They had eaten beer potage, thick with croutons and cheese, and Ciri had been surprised they had not served mushrooms as well.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22104;Blood of Elves;she had yelled, and Lambert had rebuked her sharply and ordered her to take her elbows off the table.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22128;Blood of Elves;Triss giggled.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22139;Blood of Elves;Apart from me and ... And Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
22142;Blood of Elves;Geralt had not invited Yennefer.;['Geralt', 'Yennefer'];['Geralt', 'Yennefer']
22157;Blood of Elves;'Water again?' muttered Ciri suddenly, peering into her tumbler.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22161;Blood of Elves;'Don't slouch,' said Lambert, stealing a glance at Triss from the corner of his eye.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22165;Blood of Elves;'Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22166;Blood of Elves;Triss finished her porridge.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22170;Blood of Elves;Vesemir cleared his throat and turned his eyes away.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22172;Blood of Elves;Predictable enough, Ciri's short tunic does look as if it has been cut out with a knife and sewn together with an arrow-head.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22176;Blood of Elves;Ciri, have you finished?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22179;Blood of Elves;'She's been running around in this for a year, Merigold,' said Lambert angrily.;['a year', 'Merigold', 'Lambert'];['Lambert']
22183;Blood of Elves;You're right, Lambert.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22186;Blood of Elves;The girl hesitated, looked at Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22187;Blood of Elves;Geralt nodded his agreement and smiled.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22189;Blood of Elves;Just as he had smiled in the past when, when ... Triss turned her eyes away.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22191;Blood of Elves;Ciri's little room was a faithful replica of the witchers' quarters.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22195;Blood of Elves;On the door of Ciri's little room, however, hung the skin of an enormous rat with a hideous scaly tail.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22202;Blood of Elves;'When I was in Transriver, in Kagen, I had to spin,' muttered Ciri unwillingly.;['Kagen', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
22214;Blood of Elves;Triss smiled.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22221;Blood of Elves;And if there's a need ...' Triss slowly ran her hand across the torn hole in the sleeve of Ciri's jacket, murmuring a spell while stimulating an amulet to work.;['Triss', 'Ciri'];['Triss', 'Ciri']
22223;Blood of Elves;Ciri squealed with joy.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22229;Blood of Elves;Ciri shook her head, lifted the lid of the trunk and showed her a faded loose dress, a dark grey tunic, a linen shirt and a woollen blouse resembling a penitent's sack.;['Ciri', 'grey tunic'];['Ciri']
22241;Blood of Elves;Ciri?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22254;Blood of Elves;'The windmill,' repeated Ciri, raising her huge eyes to look up at the magician.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22274;Blood of Elves;Ciri pointed indifferently to an impressive bruise below her left knee, covering her shin.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22279;Blood of Elves;Geralt says I'm already good at the pendulum.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22290;Blood of Elves;Ciri hissed with pain and blushed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22293;Blood of Elves;and the comb thumped you,' finished Triss, controlling herself with increasing difficulty.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22294;Blood of Elves;Ciri snorted.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22307;Blood of Elves;'What?' 'You catch fear,' Ciri repeated proudly, brushing her ashen fringe from her forehead.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22315;Blood of Elves;And that it came from Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22328;Blood of Elves;Two at the same time.;['Two'];['Two']
22332;Blood of Elves;Lambert says I'm a sissy and a wimp but that's not true.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22333;Blood of Elves;Geralt told me my weight is distributed a little differently because I'm a girl.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22350;Blood of Elves;Ciri, growing even redder, brought her head closer to the enchantress's chestnut hair.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22358;Blood of Elves;'Calm down, Merigold,' said Lambert.;['Merigold', 'Lambert'];['Lambert']
22364;Blood of Elves;Vesemir, Geralt, have any of you seen how terribly battered this child is?;['Vesemir', 'Geralt'];['Vesemir', 'Geralt']
22366;Blood of Elves;'Dear child,' said Vesemir gravely, 'don't let yourself get carried away by your emotions.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22377;Blood of Elves;What chance has Ciri got?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22382;Blood of Elves;A witcher?' 'That girl,' said Geralt quietly and calmly, 'that petite, delicate princess lived through the Massacre of Cintra.;['Geralt', 'the Massacre of Cintra'];['Geralt']
22388;Blood of Elves;Believe me, Triss, life has tried, seasoned and hardened her no less than good-for-nothings like us, who were brought to Kaer Morhen from the highways.;['Triss', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Triss']
22389;Blood of Elves;Ciri is no weaker than unwanted bastards, like us, who were left with witchers in taverns like kittens in a wicker basket.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22398;Blood of Elves;Despite her outrage, Triss felt an exquisite satisfaction at the sight of the sheepish expressions of the young witchers, and Vesemir's jaw suddenly dropping open.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22410;Blood of Elves;'Stop it, Triss,' moaned Geralt quietly.;['Triss', 'Geralt'];['Triss', 'Geralt']
22415;Blood of Elves;'We've turned out to be right idiots, there's no two ways about it, eh, Vesemir, and you'Silence,' growled the old witcher.;['Vesemir', 'Silence'];['Vesemir']
22417;Blood of Elves;"It was Eskel's behaviour which was most unlikely; he got up, approached the enchantress, bent down low, took her hand and kissed it respectfully.";['Eskel'];['Eskel']
22421;Blood of Elves;More powerfully than Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22422;Blood of Elves;'Triss,' he said, rubbing the hideous scar on his cheek with embarrassment, 'help us.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22424;Blood of Elves;Help us, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22427;Blood of Elves;What am I to help you with, Eskel?';['Eskel'];['Eskel']
22428;Blood of Elves;Eskel rubbed his cheek again, looked at Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22430;Blood of Elves;Vesemir cleared his throat loudly.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22431;Blood of Elves;At that moment, the door creaked open and Ciri entered the hall.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22432;Blood of Elves;Vesemir's hawking changed into something like a wheeze, a loud indrawn breath.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22437;Blood of Elves;Ciri stopped in front of Vesemir.;['Ciri', 'Vesemir'];['Ciri', 'Vesemir']
22443;Blood of Elves;'Indisposed!' ended Ciri loudly and proudly, turning her nose up almost to the ceiling.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22444;Blood of Elves;Vesemir hawked again.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22445;Blood of Elves;But Eskel, dear Eskel, kept his head and once more behaved as was fitting.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
22450;Blood of Elves;'Aha ...' Only now did Ciri blush a little - she looked at the old witcher.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22455;Blood of Elves;But Triss said you have to agree forsooth.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22462;Blood of Elves;Only now did Geralt take his hand from his forehead.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22463;Blood of Elves;'We are extremely pleased, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22465;Blood of Elves;Geralt's face seemed almost graven from stone.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22466;Blood of Elves;'You behaved very properly and politely, Ciri,' he said, 'offering Miss Merigold our ongoing hospitality in Kaer Morhen.;['Ciri', 'Merigold', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Ciri']
22468;Blood of Elves;Ciri reddened and smiled broadly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22477;Blood of Elves;Lambert broke the silence.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22480;Blood of Elves;Vesemir cast his eye around.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22482;Blood of Elves;Understood?' Eskel and Coen bestowed a look which was entirely devoid of respect on the old man.;['Eskel', 'Coen'];['Eskel']
22483;Blood of Elves;Lambert snorted loudly.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22486;Blood of Elves;'Thank you, Triss.' 'Conditions?';['Triss'];['Triss']
22487;Blood of Elves;Eskel was clearly worried.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
22489;Blood of Elves;But we've already promised to ease Ciri's training, Triss.;['Ciri', 'Triss'];['Ciri', 'Triss']
22495;Blood of Elves;'We're listening,' said Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22496;Blood of Elves;'Go on, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22497;Blood of Elves;'Above all,' she began, smiling maliciously, 'Ciri's menu is to be more varied.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22499;Blood of Elves;Geralt and Coen controlled their expressions wonderfully, Lambert and Eskel a little less so, Vesemir not at all.;['Geralt', 'Coen', 'Lambert', 'Vesemir'];['Geralt', 'Lambert', 'Vesemir']
22506;Blood of Elves;You'll see, Lambert, you'll learn how to do it in no time.';['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22507;Blood of Elves;'Triss,' started Geralt, 'listen-' 'No, you listen.;['Triss', 'Geralt'];['Triss', 'Geralt']
22508;Blood of Elves;You haven't subjected Ciri to violent mutations, haven't touched her hormones, haven't tried any elixirs or Grasses on her.;['Ciri', 'Grasses'];['Ciri']
22519;Blood of Elves;'And how,' muttered Lambert, brazenly eyeing Triss's breasts which strained against the fabric of her dress.;['Lambert', 'Triss'];['Lambert', 'Triss']
22521;Blood of Elves;'At the moment,' Geralt asked slowly, also gliding his eyes over this and that, 'you haven't noticed anything irreversible in her, I hope?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22527;Blood of Elves;'We will,' promised Vesemir.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22532;Blood of Elves;This is the second: Ciri must not be allowed to grow wild.;['second', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
22542;Blood of Elves;'Her normal life went up in flames along with Cintra,' murmured Geralt, 'but regarding this, Triss, as usual you're right.;['Cintra', 'Geralt', 'Triss'];['Geralt', 'Triss']
22545;Blood of Elves;To Nenneke.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
22548;Blood of Elves;Nenneke is an exceptional woman and Goddess Melitele's sanctuary an exceptional place.;"['Nenneke', ""Goddess Melitele's""]";['Nenneke']
22556;Blood of Elves;Triss smiled.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22562;Blood of Elves;I don't know how long it took you to recognise Ciri's magical abilities.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22570;Blood of Elves;Ciri is a Source and has mediumistic powers.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22577;Blood of Elves;'Yes,' Vesemir confirmed after a moment's silence.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22579;Blood of Elves;For a moment, she was afraid that Geralt would be the one to confirm it.;['Geralt', 'one'];['Geralt']
22582;Blood of Elves;There could be no question of running the Killer, especially since Ciri was still not feeling very well.;['Killer', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
22584;Blood of Elves;She could not be sure, however, knowing practically nothing about the drugs, and Ciri was, beyond doubt, the only girl in the world to whom they had been administered.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22587;Blood of Elves;She gave Ciri elixirs to drink, tied a string of active jaspers around her waist, under her dress, and forbade her to exert herself in any way, especially by chasing around wildly hunting rats with a sword.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22588;Blood of Elves;Ciri was bored.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22590;Blood of Elves;Geralt to the enchantress's rage disappeared somewhere and appeared only towards evening, bearing a dead goat.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22591;Blood of Elves;Triss helped him skin his prey.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22597;Blood of Elves;'Triss!' yelled Ciri suddenly, running down the stairs, stamping.;['Triss', 'Ciri'];['Triss', 'Ciri']
22605;Blood of Elves;Triss smiled.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22611;Blood of Elves;I don't know how long it took you to recognise Ciri's magical abilities.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22619;Blood of Elves;Ciri is a Source and has mediumistic powers.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22626;Blood of Elves;'Yes,' Vesemir confirmed after a moment's silence.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22628;Blood of Elves;For a moment, she was afraid that Geralt would be the one to confirm it.;['Geralt', 'one'];['Geralt']

22637;Blood of Elves;Ciri was bored.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22639;Blood of Elves;Geralt to the enchantress's rage disappeared somewhere and appeared only towards evening, bearing a dead goat.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22640;Blood of Elves;Triss helped him skin his prey.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22646;Blood of Elves;'Triss!' yelled Ciri suddenly, running down the stairs, stamping.;['Triss', 'Ciri'];['Triss', 'Ciri']
22656;Blood of Elves;Did you really think I might want to take Ciri away from you?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22657;Blood of Elves;Lambert snorted and turned his face away.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22658;Blood of Elves;Eskel and Vesemir looked at Geralt, and Geralt said nothing.;['Vesemir', 'Geralt', 'Geralt'];['Vesemir', 'Geralt', 'Geralt']
22669;Blood of Elves;'I will not tell anyone about Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22673;Blood of Elves;'Forgive me, Triss, I do not mean to offend you, but what has happened to your legendary loyalty to the Council and Chapter?';['Triss', 'Council'];['Triss']
22681;Blood of Elves;Rarely does it succeed, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22682;Blood of Elves;The enchantress turned her gaze on Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22686;Blood of Elves;'Geralt,' she said, 'when you found Ciri, on the Yaruga, you took her with you.;['Geralt', 'Ciri', 'Yaruga'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
22690;Blood of Elves;If destiny wants Ciri to become a magician, she will become one.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22694;Blood of Elves;'Were it only one,' sighed Vesemir.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22704;Blood of Elves;'Devil take it,' said Lambert after a long silence.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22709;Blood of Elves;"Geralt didn't find destiny; he found another homeless, orphaned child.";['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22712;Blood of Elves;We've had some problems with Ciri, made mistakes, and it's a good thing you've pointed them out to us.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22716;Blood of Elves;I assure you, Merigold, Ciri will leave here skilful and healthy, strong and able to face life.;['Merigold', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
22718;Blood of Elves;Unless you delude her into believing she has some such disease.' 'Vesemir,' Triss turned in her chair, 'tell him to keep quiet, he's getting in the way.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22719;Blood of Elves;'You think you know it all,' said Lambert calmly, 'but you don't.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22724;Blood of Elves;Geralt, Vesemir and Eskel glanced at Ciri anxiously but the girl paid no attention to the spectacular fireworks.;['Geralt', 'Vesemir', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Vesemir', 'Ciri']
22725;Blood of Elves;Triss folded her arms and looked at Lambert defiantly.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22730;Blood of Elves;'But Ciri can't.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22735;Blood of Elves;Ciri does not even have that.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22748;Blood of Elves;'Lambert.';['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22749;Blood of Elves;Geralt released his medallion and rested his hands on the table.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22752;Blood of Elves;Second, Triss is not exaggerating.;['Second', 'Triss'];['Triss']
22753;Blood of Elves;I saw Ciri's mother, Princess Pavetta, in action with my own eyes.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22756;Blood of Elves;'We should assume, therefore,' said Eskel, lighting the candles in yet another candle-stick, 'that Ciri could, indeed, be genetically burdened.';['Eskel', 'Ciri'];['Eskel', 'Ciri']
22757;Blood of Elves;'Not only could,' said Vesemir, 'she is so burdened.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22758;Blood of Elves;On the one hand Lambert is right.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22759;Blood of Elves;Ciri is not capable of forming Signs.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22762;Blood of Elves;He fell silent and looked at Ciri who, with a joyful squeal, acknowledged that she had the upper hand in the game.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22771;Blood of Elves;"Lambert glanced at Geralt; Geralt nodded in assent.";"['Lambert', 'Geralt; Geralt']";['Lambert']
22774;Blood of Elves;'Have a drink with us, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22782;Blood of Elves;'A mild remedy,' Eskel smiled, 'for pleasant dreams.';['Eskel'];['Eskel']
22787;Blood of Elves;'Exclusively natural ingredients,' Geralt reassured her but he looked, she noticed, disconcerted.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22796;Blood of Elves;And then-' 'It was an accident,' Geralt interrupted quickly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22801;Blood of Elves;We had such a fright,' Vesemir admitted, and sighed.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22809;Blood of Elves;'Rubbish,' said Lambert dryly.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
22814;Blood of Elves;'This once,' said Eskel gravely, rubbing the scar across his cheek, 'Lambert is right, Triss.;['Eskel', 'Lambert'];['Eskel', 'Lambert']
22823;Blood of Elves;Also after she drank a drug because of your carelessness?' 'Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
22824;Blood of Elves;Geralt raised his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22829;Blood of Elves;Ciri fell, quite by accident, during an exercise.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22839;Blood of Elves;Geralt wiped his brow, suddenly beaded with sweat, on his forearm.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22840;Blood of Elves;'Ciri often wakes up at night,' he continued.;['Ciri', 'night'];['Ciri']
22855;Blood of Elves;What, Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22856;Blood of Elves;'Death,' Vesemir said gently.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22859;Blood of Elves;Triss glanced at Ciri, who was shrilly accusing Coen of cheating.;['Ciri', 'Coen'];['Ciri']
22864;Blood of Elves;'Him,' said Vesemir.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22865;Blood of Elves;'And me,' Geralt added.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22874;Blood of Elves;Geralt looked her straight in the eyes.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22876;Blood of Elves;Don't ask about it, Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22877;Blood of Elves;We are not worried by the contents of Ciri's prophecies and ravings but about what happens to her.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22878;Blood of Elves;We're not afraid for ourselves but-' 'Careful,' warned Vesemir.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22881;Blood of Elves;'Wish everybody goodnight, Ciri,' he said.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22888;Blood of Elves;Ciri slipped off his back and reached for Eskel's chalice.;['Ciri', 'Eskel'];['Ciri', 'Eskel']
22892;Blood of Elves;She gave her half-full chalice to the girl while meaningfully squeezing Geralt's arm and looking Vesemir in the eye.;['Geralt', 'Vesemir'];['Geralt', 'Vesemir']
22893;Blood of Elves;'Drink.' 'Triss,' whispered Eskel, watching Ciri drink greedily, 'what are you doing?;['Triss', 'Ciri'];['Triss', 'Ciri']
22896;Blood of Elves;Ciri suddenly grew rigid, cried out, and smiled a broad, happy smile.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22899;Blood of Elves;Lambert moved the stool away in a flash, leaving Coen standing between the dancing girl and the hearth.;['Lambert', 'Coen'];['Lambert']
22900;Blood of Elves;Triss jumped up and tore an amulet from her pouch - a sapphire set in silver on a thin chain.;['Triss'];['Triss']
22902;Blood of Elves;'Child ...' groaned Vesemir.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
22905;Blood of Elves;'Ciri has fallen into a trance and I am going to contact her psychically.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22910;Blood of Elves;Geralt frowned.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
22916;Blood of Elves;Ciri ceased dancing, sank to her knees, extended her arms and rested her head on her lap.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22927;Blood of Elves;Ciri?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22939;Blood of Elves;Ciri was standing nearby with her back turned to her.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22947;Blood of Elves;Vanielle.;['Vanielle'];['Vanielle']
22949;Blood of Elves;Pox-marked Axel ...;['Axel'];['Axel']
22952;Blood of Elves;'Why?' Ciri turned.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22964;Blood of Elves;She stopped next to Ciri and saw that both of them stood on the edge of a bottomless chasm where reddish smoke, glowing as though it was lit from behind, was swirling.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22966;Blood of Elves;'It has to be this way,' Ciri said in a shaky voice.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22987;Blood of Elves;No ...' Ciri!';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22992;Blood of Elves;"Ciri's face suddenly changed, hardened; her voice became metallic, cold and hostile, resounding with threatening, cruel mockery.";['Ciri'];['Ciri']
22998;Blood of Elves;Triss shuddered but she kept her voice under control.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23011;Blood of Elves;Ciri's lips moved but Triss saw that the girl's eyes were dead, glazed and vacant.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23031;Blood of Elves;Ciri turned her head away.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23043;Blood of Elves;Triss?;['Triss'];['Triss']
23055;Blood of Elves;'Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23061;Blood of Elves;'What is happening to Ciri?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23066;Blood of Elves;'What you did was not the best of ideas, Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
23083;Blood of Elves;'Geralt, this is a serious matter.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23103;Blood of Elves;And you are risking Ciri's health and life in the process.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23105;Blood of Elves;Ask Yennefer for help, Geralt.';['Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']
23106;Blood of Elves;'And you, Triss?' 'What about me?';['Triss'];['Triss']
23117;Blood of Elves;You are important to me, Triss, and always will be.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23122;Blood of Elves;'I will stay with Ciri ...;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23128;Blood of Elves;And then you will ask Yennefer for help.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
23129;Blood of Elves;'All right, Triss. Thank you.';['Triss'];['Triss']
23130;Blood of Elves;'Geralt?' 'Yes.' 'Ciri said something else, didn't she?;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
23135;Blood of Elves;No, Triss.' 'Please.' 'She wasn't speaking to me.';['Triss'];['Triss']
23151;Blood of Elves;'Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23163;Blood of Elves;And then she herself would be unable to sleep for a long time, thinking about what Ciri had said in her sleep and after she came to.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23170;Blood of Elves;Ciri calmed, she slept peacefully with no nightmares, and no dreams.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23184;Blood of Elves;'No, Lambert!;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
23212;Blood of Elves;Was that really very good, Lambert?' 'Who said so?';['Lambert'];['Lambert']
23219;Blood of Elves;Ciri, where was the parry?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23245;Blood of Elves;'Lambert!;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
23246;Blood of Elves;If Triss heard that!' 'If ifs and ands were pots and pans.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23269;Blood of Elves;Ciri, how many times do I have to ask you?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23275;Blood of Elves;Geralt said so and he never lies, you know that!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23303;Blood of Elves;I warrant, Ciri, that it is better to count yourself amongst those few than amongst everyone.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23333;Blood of Elves;Ciri, don't close both your eyes or you won't see anything - you're smudging your whole face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23348;Blood of Elves;Ciri, what are you doing?' 'Don't laugh!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23357;Blood of Elves;We'll tell Lambert to warm the bathroom and we'll take a bath.';['Lambert'];['Lambert']
23359;Blood of Elves;Lambert says we're using up too much fuel with our baths.';['Lambert'];['Lambert']

23399;Blood of Elves;So how do you fight a ghoul, Ciri?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23435;Blood of Elves;Do you understand, Ciri?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23437;Blood of Elves;Geralt explained it to me.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23441;Blood of Elves;If Geralt has explained it to you, you don't have to recite it to me.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23445;Blood of Elves;"Which elixir is used to treat corpse venom poisoning, Ciri?' '""Golden Oriole"".'";['Ciri', 'Golden Oriole'];['Ciri']

23656;Blood of Elves;'Well done, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23660;Blood of Elves;In the evenings, consistently and determinedly, Triss guided the long conversations held in the dark hall, lit only by the bursts of flames in the great hearth, towards politics.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23662;Blood of Elves;Geralt, a hand on his forehead, did not say a word.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23665;Blood of Elves;Coen yawned openly and looked at the ceiling, and Lambert did nothing to hide his disdain.;['Coen', 'Lambert'];['Lambert']
23669;Blood of Elves;That evening Triss was irritable and restless - perhaps it was the wind howling along the great castle's walls.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23670;Blood of Elves;And that evening they were all oddly excited - the witchers, apart from Geralt, were unusually talkative.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23674;Blood of Elves;This time it was Triss who began to yawn and stare at the ceiling.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23675;Blood of Elves;This time she was the one who remained silent - until Eskel turned to her with a question.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
23684;Blood of Elves;'So what?' said Lambert.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
23695;Blood of Elves;'And the lord barons and village elders,' added Eskel, 'have their heads full of the war and don't have the time to defend their subjects.;['Eskel'];['Eskel']
23698;Blood of Elves;But from what Triss has been telling us all these evenings, it seems the conflict with Nilfgaard is more serious than that, not just some local little war.;['Triss', 'Nilfgaard'];['Triss']

23837;Blood of Elves;But I will never wear a plunging neckline again, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23840;Blood of Elves;Neither did Ciri, who had slipped into the hall without a sound and stopped at the threshold, hunching her shoulders and folding her arms.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23856;Blood of Elves;shouted Ciri shrilly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23860;Blood of Elves;'Be quiet,' growled Lambert.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
23867;Blood of Elves;'And therefore you'll stop learning,' said Geralt in a voice colder than the walls of Kaer Morhen.;['Geralt', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Geralt']
23873;Blood of Elves;'Understood?' Ciri raised her head abruptly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23877;Blood of Elves;'Geralt, I-' 'Get out.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23878;Blood of Elves;Ciri spun on her heel and stood still for a moment, undecided, as if waiting - waiting for something that could not happen.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23881;Blood of Elves;'Too severe, Wolf,' said Vesemir.;['Wolf', 'Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
23883;Blood of Elves;And you shouldn't have done it in Triss's presence.;['Triss'];['Triss']
23889;Blood of Elves;Why, Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
23890;Blood of Elves;Ciri is normal.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
23896;Blood of Elves;Oh yes, Geralt, it annoys you, it annoys you so much that you are starting to think about Kaer Morhen's vaults, about the Laboratorium, the dusty demijohns full of mutagenic poisons-' 'Triss!' called Vesemir, gazing at Geralt's face, suddenly grown pale.;"['Geralt', ""Kaer Morhen's"", 'Vesemir', 'Geralt']";['Geralt', 'Vesemir', 'Geralt']

24031;Blood of Elves;Triss turned her head away without replying, bit her lip and curled up even tighter.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24033;Blood of Elves;Having allowed her to rest for a while they hauled the enchantress onto Roach's saddle.;['Roach'];['Roach']
24034;Blood of Elves;Geralt sat behind her, supporting her with both hands, while Ciri rode beside them, holding the reins and leading Triss's gelding.;['Ciri', 'Triss'];['Ciri', 'Triss']
24036;Blood of Elves;"The enchantress kept falling from Geralt's hands; she could not stay in the saddle.";['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24039;Blood of Elves;Geralt told himself that it was an allergic reaction to the traces of magic in his witcher's elixir.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24045;Blood of Elves;Geralt could neither contest it nor argue.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24059;Blood of Elves;The soldier shook his head, spat and looked at Ciri and Triss, huddled in the saddle.;['Ciri', 'Triss'];['Ciri', 'Triss']
24063;Blood of Elves;A little further, between the palisade fence and a wooden well with a sweep, Geralt made out six still bodies wrapped in sacking from which only pairs of feet in worn, dirty boots protruded.;['Geralt', 'six'];['Geralt']
24074;Blood of Elves;'Two guards from here, two of our relief troops and two ... two of the others,' he said, pulling up a corner of the stiff material.;['Two', 'two', 'two ... two'];['Two']
24081;Blood of Elves;Ciri huffed, unwilling, but obeyed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24095;Blood of Elves;Geralt shook his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24119;Blood of Elves;Hey, Unist!;['Unist'];['Unist']
24124;Blood of Elves;He goes by the name Geralt of Rivia.';['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']
24125;Blood of Elves;To Geralt's astonishment, the knight gave a broad smile, approached and held a hand out in greeting.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24129;Blood of Elves;Geralt explained what brought him there.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24193;Blood of Elves;Geralt looked around.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24198;Blood of Elves;The knight measured Ciri with his eyes then turned back to the merchant with the noble face, evidently considering him the most serious partner in the discussion.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24255;Blood of Elves;'It bodes not well with her, sir,' said the soldier, indicating Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24258;Blood of Elves;Geralt made no comment because there was nothing to say.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24267;Blood of Elves;Geralt, listen to me.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24282;Blood of Elves;Ciri, who was trying to clean her dung-smeared boot on a ladder rung, raised her head.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24284;Blood of Elves;Geralt smiled faintly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24289;Blood of Elves;'Geralt, sir, I know what you need to do.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24323;Blood of Elves;Geralt approached, holding his hands out so they could be seen even by someone afflicted with conjunctivitis or night blindness.;['Geralt', 'night'];['Geralt']
24327;Blood of Elves;'Either my eyes deceive me,' he said, 'or it's the witcher Geralt of Rivia.;['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']
24330;Blood of Elves;'Yarpen Zigrin,' declared Geralt, astonished.;['Yarpen Zigrin', 'Geralt'];['Yarpen', 'Geralt']
24331;Blood of Elves;'None other than Yarpen Zigrin in person, complete with beard!';['Yarpen Zigrin', 'beard'];['Yarpen']
24337;Blood of Elves;The rest of the gathering visibly relaxed and Geralt thought he heard deep sighs of relief.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24346;Blood of Elves;This is Yannick Brass, this one's Xavier Moran and here's Paulie Dahlberg and his brother Regan.';['Yannick Brass', 'Xavier Moran', 'Paulie Dahlberg', 'Regan'];['Yannick', 'Xavier', 'Paulie', 'Regan']
24347;Blood of Elves;Geralt didn't remember any of them, and besides they all looked alike, bearded, stocky, practically square in their thick quilted jerkins.;['Geralt', 'stocky'];['Geralt']
24349;Blood of Elves;'You've a good memory,' laughed Yarpen Zigrin.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
24351;Blood of Elves;But Lucas Corto got married, settled down in Mahakam and dropped out of the company, the stupid oaf.;['Lucas Corto', 'Mahakam'];['Lucas']
24354;Blood of Elves;To eat a calf, knock back a barrel, there's nothing like six-' 'As I see,' with a nod Geralt indicated the rest of the group standing undecided by the wagons, 'there are enough of you here to manage three calves, not to mention a quantity of poultry.;['Geralt', 'three'];['Geralt']
24355;Blood of Elves;What's this gang of fellows you're commanding, Yarpen?';['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24358;Blood of Elves;Forgive me, Wenck, for not doing so straight away but me and my boys have known Geralt of Rivia for a long time - we've a fair number of shared memories behind us.;['Wenck', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
24359;Blood of Elves;Geralt, this is Commissar Vilfrid Wenck, in the service of King Henselt of Ard Carraigh, the merciful ruler of Kaedwen.';['Geralt', 'Commissar Vilfrid Wenck', 'King Henselt', 'Ard \r\nCarraigh', 'Kaedwen'];['Geralt']
24360;Blood of Elves;Vilfrid Wenck was tall, taller than Geralt and near twice the dwarf's height.;['Vilfrid Wenck', 'Geralt'];['Vilfrid', 'Geralt']
24364;Blood of Elves;Geralt was prepared to wager any sum on it.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24368;Blood of Elves;'Tell us what you're doing in this neighbourhood, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24381;Blood of Elves;Geralt, will your sick woman hold up in the saddle?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24385;Blood of Elves;Quick!' Vilfrid Wenck, crossing his arms, hawked loudly.;['Vilfrid Wenck'];['Vilfrid']
24389;Blood of Elves;Yarpen removed his palm from Triss's forehead.;['Yarpen', 'Triss'];['Yarpen', 'Triss']
24392;Blood of Elves;What if it's typhoid or dysentery?' 'It can't be typhoid or dysentery,' Geralt lied with conviction, wrapping the horse blankets around the sick woman.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24407;Blood of Elves;'Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24411;Blood of Elves;Tm here,' said Ciri, stroking her chestnut hair.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24416;Blood of Elves;For your stomach.' 'Geralt,' sobbed Triss, trying to disentangle herself from the blankets.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24424;Blood of Elves;Ciri sighed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24430;Blood of Elves;Ciri pointed to the darkness.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24440;Blood of Elves;I'm called Yarpen Zigrin.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
24442;Blood of Elves;'Something other than Little Goose,' snarled Ciri with a gleam in her eyes.;['Little Goose', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
24457;Blood of Elves;Yarpen snorted again.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24460;Blood of Elves;Will the young lady accept it or will she send the old boor, Yarpen Zigrin, away?';['Yarpen', 'Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
24462;Blood of Elves;Ciri had second thoughts and lowered her head.;['Ciri', 'second'];['Ciri']
24468;Blood of Elves;'Come on, Ciri, you help me.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24474;Blood of Elves;'You should know, Ciri,' said Yarpen, 'that my grandmother knew her medicine like nobody's business.;['Ciri', 'Yarpen'];['Ciri', 'Yarpen']
24482;Blood of Elves;'My grandmother,' Ciri nodded in understanding, 'thrashed me once, too.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24507;Blood of Elves;'Yarpen,' Geralt hissed, emerging abruptly from the darkness with the magician in his arms.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24515;Blood of Elves;Geralt, it really ought to help . . .';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24517;Blood of Elves;Yarpen nudged Geralt with his elbow, turning his beard up proudly and pointing to Triss, who swallowed the pellets with a martyred expression.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24520;Blood of Elves;'What are you saying, Triss?';['Triss'];['Triss']
24547;Blood of Elves;'So what are you transporting?' 'Salt fish,' said Yarpen casually, and proceeded to embellish his lie without batting an eyelid.;['Salt', 'Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24550;Blood of Elves;'If he's quartermaster then I'm a druid,' smiled Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24553;Blood of Elves;But you can see the state Triss is in.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24554;Blood of Elves;Let us join you, Yarpen, let us put her in one of the wagons.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24570;Blood of Elves;But be that as it may, you're mighty attracted to this enchantress, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24573;Blood of Elves;Yarpen indicated Ciri with his head as she wriggled under the sheepskin.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24577;Blood of Elves;Ciri felt she had slept no more than a few minutes, as though she had been woken up the very minute she lay her head down on the sacks heaped on the wagon.;['Ciri', 'a few minutes'];['Ciri']
24578;Blood of Elves;Geralt was just settling Triss down next to her, having brought her in from another enforced expedition into the woods.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24580;Blood of Elves;Geralt had dark circles under his eyes.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24581;Blood of Elves;Ciri knew he had not closed them for an instant Triss had run a fever through the night and suffered greatly.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24588;Blood of Elves;'Better, but ... Listen, Geralt ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24590;Blood of Elves;The witcher leaned over but Triss was already asleep.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24592;Blood of Elves;'Geralt,' whispered Ciri, 'are they going to let us travel on the wagon?';['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
24599;Blood of Elves;Ciri heard the sound of the camp packing up - horses stamping, harnesses ringing, poles squeaking, swingle-trees grating, and talking and cursing.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24601;Blood of Elves;And the cold voice of Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24608;Blood of Elves;He was silent for a while, and Geralt and Yarpin waited patiently.;['Geralt', 'Yarpin'];['Geralt']
24627;Blood of Elves;Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24639;Blood of Elves;Ciri heard Yarpen Zigrin hiss loudly and cough into his rolled-up sleeve.;['Ciri', 'Yarpen Zigrin'];['Ciri', 'Yarpen']
24645;Blood of Elves;As for you, Geralt ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24649;Blood of Elves;The witcher gave a nod which seemed, to Ciri, to be somewhat deeper and politer than usual.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24655;Blood of Elves;'Yes, Geralt?' 'Thank you.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24656;Blood of Elves;The commissar bowed his head, a bit more deeply and politely, it seemed to Ciri, than the usual, perfunctory politeness required.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24659;Blood of Elves;The bump woke Triss up but Ciri reassured her and changed the compress on her forehead.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24660;Blood of Elves;"The rattling had a soporific effect and the magician was soon asleep; Ciri, too, fell to dozing.";['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24665;Blood of Elves;From conversations between the dwarves, she had gathered that his name was Paulie Dahlberg.;['Paulie Dahlberg'];['Paulie']
24666;Blood of Elves;Next to him sat his brother Regan.;['Regan'];['Regan']
24668;Blood of Elves;Roach, Geralt's mare, tethered to the wagon, greeted her with a quiet neigh.;['Roach', 'Geralt'];['Roach', 'Geralt']
24669;Blood of Elves;She couldn't see her chestnut anywhere or Triss's dun.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24671;Blood of Elves;Geralt was sitting on the coachman's box next to Yarpen.;['Geralt', 'Yarpen'];['Geralt', 'Yarpen']
24674;Blood of Elves;Geralt expressed interest about how five wagons of salted fish could help Aedirn's defence.;['Geralt', 'five', 'Aedirn'];['Geralt']
24675;Blood of Elves;Yarpen, ignoring the gibe in Geralt's voice, explained that some species of fish were so valuable that a few wagon-loads would suffice to pay an armoured company for a year, and each new armoured company was a considerable help.;['Yarpen', 'Geralt', 'a year'];['Yarpen', 'Geralt']
24676;Blood of Elves;Geralt was surprised that the aid had to be quite so secretive, to which the dwarf replied that was why the secret was a secret.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24677;Blood of Elves;Triss tossed in her sleep, shook the compress off and talked indistinctly to herself.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24680;Blood of Elves;Ciri also felt sleepy but was brought to her senses by Yarpen's chuckle, as he reminded Geralt of their past adventures.;['Ciri', 'Yarpen', 'Geralt'];['Ciri', 'Yarpen', 'Geralt']
24683;Blood of Elves;Geralt asked about what had happened to the Slashers but Yarpen didn't know.;['Geralt', 'Slashers', 'Yarpen'];['Geralt', 'Yarpen']
24684;Blood of Elves;Yarpen, in turn, was curious about a woman called Yennefer, at which Geralt grew oddly uncommunicative.;['Yarpen', 'Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yarpen', 'Yennefer', 'Geralt']
24685;Blood of Elves;The dwarf drank more beer and started to complain that Yennefer still bore him a grudge although a good few years had gone by since those days.;['Yennefer', 'a good few years', 'those days'];['Yennefer']
24689;Blood of Elves;Ciri giggled, imagining Yarpen with the grass.;['Ciri', 'Yarpen'];['Ciri', 'Yarpen']
24690;Blood of Elves;Geralt grunted something about women and their impulsive natures - which the dwarf considered far too mild a description for maliciousness, obstinacy and vindictiveness.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24691;Blood of Elves;Geralt did not take up the subject and Ciri fell into dozing once more.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
24693;Blood of Elves;Yarpen's voice to be exact - he was yelling.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24708;Blood of Elves;'Well!' growled Yarpen turning away.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24713;Blood of Elves;'No, Yarpen,' said Geralt quietly.;['Yarpen', 'Geralt'];['Yarpen', 'Geralt']
24730;Blood of Elves;yelled Yarpen.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24735;Blood of Elves;Geralt turned away.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24739;Blood of Elves;Yarpen waited for him to untether his mare from the ladder, then whipped his horses once again, growling something incomprehensible, sounding terrifying under his breath.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24746;Blood of Elves;Ciri put her hands on her hips, shook her ashen fringe and turned up her nose.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24750;Blood of Elves;'Don't yell, Triss has just fallen asleep!';['Triss'];['Triss']
24761;Blood of Elves;'Dozing off, eh Yarpen?' growled Paulie Dahlberg as he approached.;['Yarpen', 'Paulie Dahlberg'];['Yarpen', 'Paulie']
24765;Blood of Elves;roared Yarpen Zigrin and furiously lashed the horses' hindquarters with the reins.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
24766;Blood of Elves;'You were lucky,' said Ciri, ever so sweetly, squeezing onto the box next to the dwarf.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24777;Blood of Elves;'I'm Yarpen.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24788;Blood of Elves;"'Right.' 'Yarpen?' 'Huh?' 'What does it mean, ""remain neutral""?' 'To be indifferent,' he muttered reluctantly.";['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24794;Blood of Elves;'If the Scoia'tael attack us, your Geralt intends to stand by and look calmly on as they cut our throats.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24810;Blood of Elves;'I know,' said Yarpen sourly.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24817;Blood of Elves;'Unfortunately.' Ciri stayed silent for a long time, biting her lower lip and wrinkling her nose.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24822;Blood of Elves;Yarpen snorted, wiped his nose on his sleeve and leaned out of the box to check that Wenck had not ridden up too close.;['Yarpen', 'Wenck'];['Yarpen']
24823;Blood of Elves;But the commissar was far away, engaged in conversation with Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24836;Blood of Elves;Ciri raised her head and gazed at the dwarf with wide-open green eyes.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24841;Blood of Elves;And now there are people here so the elves-' 'Elves!' snorted Yarpen.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24847;Blood of Elves;As far as this part of the world is concerned - because the world is unimaginably huge, Ciri.' 'I know.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24864;Blood of Elves;And it's just as hard to compete with you people in murdering as it is in screwing-' 'Yarpen,' said Geralt coldly, riding up on Roach.;['Geralt', 'Roach'];['Geralt', 'Roach']
24866;Blood of Elves;And Ciri, stop playing at being a coachwoman and have a care for Triss, check if she's awake and needs anything.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24870;Blood of Elves;Don't disturb them, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24874;Blood of Elves;'Go ahead,' agreed Yarpen Zigrin.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
24881;Blood of Elves;'Don't judge her by appearances, Paulie,' said Yarpen seriously as he skilfully divided the roasted grey hare into portions.;['Paulie', 'Yarpen'];['Paulie', 'Yarpen']
24887;Blood of Elves;Ciri squatted next to the dwarves sprawled around the fire.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24888;Blood of Elves;This time Yarpen Zigrin and his four 'boys' had lit their own fire at the camp because they did not intend to share the hare which Xavier Moran had shot.;['Yarpen Zigrin', 'four', 'Xavier Moran'];['Yarpen', 'Xavier']
24890;Blood of Elves;Add some wood to the fire,' said Yarpen, licking his fingers.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24892;Blood of Elves;'That water's a stupid idea,' stated Regan Dahlberg, spitting out a bone.;['Regan Dahlberg'];['Regan']
24895;Blood of Elves;You remember old Schrader?;['Schrader'];['Schrader']
24899;Blood of Elves;'I think,' said Ciri, checking the temperature of the water in the cauldron with her finger, 'it's excessive to wash every day too.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24901;Blood of Elves;So Geralt and I-' 'We know.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24906;Blood of Elves;Would you carry her into the bushes if she had to-' 'Shut up, Paulie.';['Shut', 'Paulie'];['Paulie']
24907;Blood of Elves;Yarpen cut him short.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24910;Blood of Elves;I'm only surprised-' 'Triss,' Ciri butted in cheekily, 'is not his woman.';['Triss'];['Triss']
24913;Blood of Elves;'Ciri, pour a bit of water in to boil.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24916;Blood of Elves;'Probably did,' murmured Yannick Brass.;"[""'Probably"", 'Yannick Brass']";['Yannick']
24923;Blood of Elves;The Scoia'tael-' 'Spit that word out, Yannick.';['Yannick'];['Yannick']
24937;Blood of Elves;'Pox on it,' said Paulie Dahlberg and gave a long burp.;['Paulie Dahlberg'];['Paulie']
24940;Blood of Elves;'As long as it's not kasha,' said Xavier Moran.;['Xavier Moran'];['Xavier']
24952;Blood of Elves;'Where?' growled Yannick Brass.;['Yannick Brass'];['Yannick']
24958;Blood of Elves;Ciri licked her spoon clean and slipped it into the top of her boot.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24965;Blood of Elves;Regan!;['Regan'];['Regan']
24969;Blood of Elves;Didn't mother say you have to listen to me?' 'Hurry up if you want to go fishing because dusk is just round the corner,' said Yarpen.;['Hurry', 'Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24971;Blood of Elves;Ciri, is the water hot yet?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24974;Blood of Elves;"Geralt was already waiting for them; they could see his white hair through the gap in the canvas covering the wagon from afar.";['Geralt', 'wagon'];['Geralt']
24977;Blood of Elves;'No, thank you, Yarpen.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
24978;Blood of Elves;Ciri will help.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24979;Blood of Elves;Triss was no longer running a high temperature but she was extremely weak.;['Triss'];['Triss']
24980;Blood of Elves;Geralt and Ciri were, by now, efficient at undressing and washing her.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
24983;Blood of Elves;They coped exceptionally well - he supported the enchantress in his arms, Ciri washed and dried her.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24984;Blood of Elves;Only one thing had started to surprise and annoy Ciri -Triss, in her opinion, snuggled up to Geralt too tightly.;['Only one', 'Ciri \r\n-Triss', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
24986;Blood of Elves;Geralt indicated the magician's saddle-bags with his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24990;Blood of Elves;In Ciri's opinion, definitely a little too tightly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
24991;Blood of Elves;'Oh, Geralt,' she sobbed.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
24999;Blood of Elves;I could even-' 'Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
25000;Blood of Elves;'I envy Yennefer ...;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
25003;Blood of Elves;She jumped out of the wagon and straight onto Yarpen who was waiting, leaning against a wheel and pensively chewing a blade of grass.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25005;Blood of Elves;He did not need to lean over in order to do so, as Geralt did.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25013;Blood of Elves;Come on, let's go and see how many trout have jumped into Regan's breeches.' 'Yarpen?' 'Huh?';"[""Regan's"", 'Yarpen']";['Yarpen']
25021;Blood of Elves;Ciri freed herself from his heavy arm.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25026;Blood of Elves;'Yarpen?' 'Yes?' 'Who's right?;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25028;Blood of Elves;Geralt wants to be ... neutral.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25033;Blood of Elves;Why, Yarpen?;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25046;Blood of Elves;Ciri also remained silent.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25050;Blood of Elves;Because I, Yarpen Zigrin, coward, traitor and renegade, state that we should not kill each other.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
25059;Blood of Elves;Ciri did not ask the questions pressing to her lips.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25072;Blood of Elves;'We're not different at all, Yarpen.';['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25074;Blood of Elves;'We're not different at all,' repeated Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25075;Blood of Elves;'After all, you think and feel like Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25078;Blood of Elves;You help Triss and so do I.;['Triss'];['Triss']
25089;Blood of Elves;The commissar trotted up to Yarpen's wagon and Geralt approached from the other side.;['Yarpen', 'Geralt'];['Yarpen', 'Geralt']
25090;Blood of Elves;'Get in the back, Ciri,' he said brusquely.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25092;Blood of Elves;Stay with Triss.';['Triss'];['Triss']
25095;Blood of Elves;growled Yarpen.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25111;Blood of Elves;Ciri saw Paulie Dahlberg, in the wagon behind her, place two readied crossbows on his knee and Regan covered them with a cloak.;['Paulie Dahlberg', 'two', 'Regan'];['Paulie', 'Regan']
25112;Blood of Elves;Ciri crept stealthily out from under the canvas, hiding behind Yarpen's broad back.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25121;Blood of Elves;Lance-corporal Zyvik asks, and he is unused to asking twice!;['Zyvik'];['Zyvik']
25171;Blood of Elves;Prisoners?' sneered Yannick Brass, sprawled in the coachman's box.;['Yannick Brass'];['Yannick']
25175;Blood of Elves;'Hooves,' snapped Paulie Dahlberg.;['Hooves', 'Paulie Dahlberg'];['Paulie']
25179;Blood of Elves;The lance-corporal waved his hand, smacked his lips at his horse, rode up to the vanguard and peered into Yarpen's wagon.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25189;Blood of Elves;And this child?' 'Dried mushrooms,' said Ciri looking at him impudently.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25195;Blood of Elves;The soldier could barely look away from Ciri's green eyes.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25207;Blood of Elves;'You heard, Geralt?' snarled Yarpen Zigrin, watching the patrol ride away.;['Geralt', 'Yarpen Zigrin'];['Geralt', 'Yarpen']
25214;Blood of Elves;Ciri pulled her chestnut up sharply, and then launched into a gallop, leaning low in the saddle.;['Ciri', 'gallop'];['Ciri']
25215;Blood of Elves;Geralt, engrossed in conversation with Wenck, suddenly sat up straight.;['Geralt', 'Wenck'];['Geralt']
25223;Blood of Elves;Not too quickly, not too fiercely, Ciri!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25234;Blood of Elves;Yarpen Zigrin.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
25243;Blood of Elves;The horse extended its neck as Ciri gave it free rein.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25254;Blood of Elves;Ciri was, after all, a mounted foray now, a patrol, an advance guard.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25257;Blood of Elves;I'll report it, and thin Master Wenck with his cold, blue eyes will nod his head gravely, Yarpen Zigrin will bare his yellow, horse teeth, Paulie Dahlberg will shout: 'Well done, little one!', and Geralt will smile faintly.;['Yarpen Zigrin', 'Paulie Dahlberg', 'one', 'Geralt'];['Yarpen', 'Paulie', 'Geralt']
25259;Blood of Elves;Ciri looked around and took a mental note.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25260;Blood of Elves;Two felled birches -no problem.;['Two'];['Two']
25271;Blood of Elves;Ciri abandoned the path and, wanting to scrutinise the area from a height, climbed the steep slope.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25286;Blood of Elves;Before Geralt had ordered her to leave, Ciri had managed to take a look at the corpses in the fort.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
25291;Blood of Elves;Geralt says you have to remain neutral ... And Yarpen says you have to behave in such a way that you don't have to ask for forgiveness ...;['Geralt', 'Yarpen'];['Geralt', 'Yarpen']
25299;Blood of Elves;Ciri had not forgotten - although she very much wanted to forget - what had happened in Cintra.;['Ciri', 'Cintra'];['Ciri']
25315;Blood of Elves;Ciri wiped her face, looked down at her hand, taken aback.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25356;Blood of Elves;They disappeared but Ciri did not move.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25363;Blood of Elves;'Geralt?' 'Quiet, I said.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25374;Blood of Elves;Geralt looked around, alert.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25378;Blood of Elves;Not to Yarpen, not to Wenck.;['Yarpen', 'Wenck'];['Yarpen']
25385;Blood of Elves;Whose side are we on, Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25398;Blood of Elves;'Why do you think that such a vital load of gold and silver, King Henselt's secret aid for Aedirn, is being escorted by dwarves and not humans?;['Henselt', 'Aedirn'];['Henselt']
25401;Blood of Elves;The Scoia'tael will not attack the dwarves, Ciri.';"[""Scoia'tael"", 'Ciri']";['Ciri']

25435;Blood of Elves;'They left,' whispered Ciri, 'but now they're coming back.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25449;Blood of Elves;Geralt leapt across the stream and went in amongst what remained of the columns.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25450;Blood of Elves;Ciri followed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25453;Blood of Elves;Ciri sighed loudly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25458;Blood of Elves;'Aelirenn,' said Geralt after a long silence.;['Aelirenn', 'Geralt'];['Aelirenn', 'Geralt']
25459;Blood of Elves;'She's beautiful,' whispered Ciri, grabbing him by the hand.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25462;Blood of Elves;'Aelirenn,' he repeated after a while.;['Aelirenn'];['Aelirenn']
25480;Blood of Elves;Ciri did not say anything, staring at the beautiful, still face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25485;Blood of Elves;and for Aelirenn.;['Aelirenn'];['Aelirenn']
25489;Blood of Elves;You remember what Yarpen told you?;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25494;Blood of Elves;They followed Aelirenn, the White Rose of Shaerrawedd.;['Aelirenn', 'the White Rose of Shaerrawedd'];['Aelirenn']
25497;Blood of Elves;Ciri was silent.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25498;Blood of Elves;Geralt drew her to himself, put his arm around her.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25504;Blood of Elves;Elves continue to come to Shaerrawedd, Ciri.;['Shaerrawedd', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
25517;Blood of Elves;Geralt, I ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25525;Blood of Elves;Ciri pinned the rose under the lacing of her jerkin.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25535;Blood of Elves;To the horses, Geralt!' 'Ciri!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25542;Blood of Elves;Ciri did not hold her chestnut back and shot past them at full speed, flakes of froth skimming across her face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25543;Blood of Elves;Behind her she heard Roach neigh and Geralt's curses as he was forced to a halt.;['Roach', 'Geralt'];['Roach', 'Geralt']
25548;Blood of Elves;Ciri, ignoring Geralt's shouts from behind her, directed her horse straight at the first two wagons brought to the fore.;['Ciri', 'Geralt', 'first', 'two'];['Ciri', 'Geralt']
25549;Blood of Elves;One was lying on its side and Yarpen Zigrin, axe in one hand, crossbow in the other, stood next to it.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
25552;Blood of Elves;Ciri straightened in the saddle, thumping her horse with her heels.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25555;Blood of Elves;She heard Geralt shout, ordering her to flee into the woods.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25565;Blood of Elves;She fell softly on the body of the overturned wagon, used her hands to balance herself and jumped again, landing with bent knees next to Yarpen who was roaring and brandishing his axe.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25566;Blood of Elves;Next to them, on the second wagon, Paulie Dahlberg was fighting while Regan, leaning back and bracing his legs against the board, was struggling to hold on to the harnessed horses.;['second', 'Paulie Dahlberg', 'Regan'];['Paulie', 'Regan']
25568;Blood of Elves;She rushed to Triss, who lay amongst the scattered barrels and chests, grabbed her by her clothes and started to drag her towards the overturned wagon.;['Triss'];['Triss']
25570;Blood of Elves;Right by Ciri's side, hooves suddenly clattered and horses snorted - two elves, brandishing their swords, were pressing the madly fighting Yarpen hard.;['Ciri', 'two', 'Yarpen'];['Ciri', 'Yarpen']
25574;Blood of Elves;The wagon-man hung inertly from the box and Yannick Brass stood next to him, barely keeping his balance.;['Yannick Brass'];['Yannick']
25578;Blood of Elves;yelled Yarpen, shouting over the noise.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25580;Blood of Elves;Yannick!';['Yannick'];['Yannick']
25582;Blood of Elves;Yannick threw the reins down and jumped off - straight under the third Scoia'tael's horse.;"['Yannick', 'third', ""Scoia'tael""]";['Yannick']
25588;Blood of Elves;Ciri dragged the enchantress under Yarpen's overturned wagon.;['Ciri', 'Yarpen'];['Ciri', 'Yarpen']
25589;Blood of Elves;Paulie Dahlberg, who suddenly found himself next to her, helped, while Geralt covered them both, shoving Roach between them and the charging Scoia'tael.;"['Paulie Dahlberg', 'Geralt', 'Roach', ""Scoia'tael""]";['Paulie', 'Geralt', 'Roach']
25590;Blood of Elves;All around the wagon, battle seethed: Ciri heard shouting, blades clashing, horses snorting, hooves clattering.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25591;Blood of Elves;Yarpen, Wenck and Geralt, surrounded on all sides by the elves, fought like raging demons.;['Yarpen', 'Wenck and Geralt'];['Yarpen']
25592;Blood of Elves;The fighters were suddenly parted by Regan's span as he struggled in the coachman's box with a halfling wearing a lynx fur hat.;['Regan'];['Regan']
25593;Blood of Elves;The halfling was sitting on Regan trying to jab him with a long knife.;['Regan'];['Regan']
25594;Blood of Elves;Yarpen deftly leaped onto the wagon, caught the halfling by the neck and kicked him overboard.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25597;Blood of Elves;'Circle, Regan!' roared Yarpen.;['Circle', 'Regan', 'Yarpen'];['Regan', 'Yarpen']
25602;Blood of Elves;Ciri heard an excruciating scream.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25604;Blood of Elves;Yarpen ducked, the blade rang against the hoop supporting the canvas and the momentum carried the elf forward.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25609;Blood of Elves;Yarpen roared, whirling his axe.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']
25611;Blood of Elves;Chase a circle, Regan!;['Chase', 'Regan'];['Regan']
25613;Blood of Elves;Regan, tossing his bloodied mane of hair, hunched in the box amidst the whizzing of arrows, howled like the damned, and mercilessly lashed the horses on.;['Regan'];['Regan']
25614;Blood of Elves;The span dashed in a tight circle, creating a moving barricade belching flames and smoke around the overturned wagon beneath which Ciri had dragged the semiconscious, battered magician.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25616;Blood of Elves;"Wenck was hunched over; Ciri saw the white feathers of an arrow sticking out of his side.";['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25618;Blood of Elves;As Ciri watched another arrow struck him in the back.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25621;Blood of Elves;Ciri was left alone.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25626;Blood of Elves;Ciri suddenly realised that it was not the ground.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25628;Blood of Elves;Paulie Dahlberg, keeping the elf charging at him at bay with his axe, dragged the wounded Wenck along the ground.;['Paulie Dahlberg', 'Wenck'];['Paulie']
25629;Blood of Elves;Roach flitted past, beside the wagon, and Geralt threw himself at the elf.;['Roach', 'Geralt'];['Roach', 'Geralt']
25641;Blood of Elves;Ciri screamed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25642;Blood of Elves;Yarpen Zigrin leaped from the wagon.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
25644;Blood of Elves;Yarpen avoided the blow with an agile half-turn dodge, grunted and struck ferociously, chopping in to black-beard -throat, jaw and face, right up to the nose.;['Yarpen', 'half'];['Yarpen']
25646;Blood of Elves;'Geraaaallllttt!' screamed Ciri, feeling something move behind her.;['Geraaaallllttt', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
25654;Blood of Elves;Ciri was in no state to move.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25656;Blood of Elves;Because the elf was not looking at Ciri but at the white rose pinned to her jerkin.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25657;Blood of Elves;'Aelirenn!' shouted the Squirrel loudly as if wanting to shatter her hesitation with the cry.;['Aelirenn', 'Squirrel'];['Aelirenn']
25659;Blood of Elves;Geralt, shoving Ciri away, slashed her broadly across the chest with his sword.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
25661;Blood of Elves;'Aelirenn ...' moaned the elf shrilly, collapsing to her knees.;['Aelirenn'];['Aelirenn']
25664;Blood of Elves;Through the monotonous, dull hum which filled her ears, Ciri began to hear voices.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
25666;Blood of Elves;'Ciri,' whispered Geralt who was kneeling next to her.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25669;Blood of Elves;'Geralt, what-' 'It's all over.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25677;Blood of Elves;'She hit her head falling out of the wagon when Yarpen tried to rescue it.;['Yarpen'];['Yarpen']

25698;Blood of Elves;Yannick Brass was amongst them.;['Yannick Brass'];['Yannick']
25701;Blood of Elves;And next to them ... 'Paulie!' sobbed Regan Dahlberg, holding his brother's head on his knees.;['Regan Dahlberg'];['Regan']
25707;Blood of Elves;Regan turned his contorted face, wet with tears, towards them.;['Regan'];['Regan']
25716;Blood of Elves;'Lady enchantress?;['Lady'];['Lady']
25728;Blood of Elves;said Triss severely.;['Triss'];['Triss']

25785;Blood of Elves;he repeated, gazing at Geralt with wide eyes as blue as the sky.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
25792;Blood of Elves;Geralt leaned his elbows on the railing and spat into the water eddying at the barge's wake.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

26105;Blood of Elves;The considerable salinity and atypical chemical composition of the water, especially during high tide-' 'During high tide,' interrupted Geralt, 'when the incoming tide wave passes the Novigrad canals, there is no water - to use the word precisely - in the Delta at all.;['Geralt', 'Novigrad', 'Delta'];['Geralt']

26325;Blood of Elves;Boatbug uttered, licking the burbot's skin clean.;['Boatbug'];['Boatbug']
26338;Blood of Elves;roared Olsen angrily.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26341;Blood of Elves;Boratek, charge him to the penny!;['Boratek'];['Boratek']

26385;Blood of Elves;'So they are, true,' agreed Boatbug.;['Boatbug'];['Boatbug']
26400;Blood of Elves;warned Olsen, ducking behind the rail.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26404;Blood of Elves;'Aren't you sailing straight by way of the Oxenfurt arm, Boatbug?' asked Olsen.;['Oxenfurt', 'Boatbug', 'Olsen'];['Boatbug', 'Olsen']
26416;Blood of Elves;Something smells funny here, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26418;Blood of Elves;Linus Pitt was afraid, glancing nervously at the aqueduct and the great scientific success.;['Linus Pitt'];['Linus']
26420;Blood of Elves;Boatbug pointed to Everett who was still milling around nearby.;['Boatbug', 'Everett'];['Boatbug', 'Everett']
26428;Blood of Elves;Boatbug chuckled.;['Boatbug'];['Boatbug']
26429;Blood of Elves;Linus Pitt looked at the witcher with eyes filled with the distaste which befitted someone looking at a white-haired man who has drawn the attention of the law on account of his preference for underage girls.;['Linus Pitt'];['Linus']
26430;Blood of Elves;'That's why,' Olsen hawked, 'the Temerian customs officers thought it might be some private matters being settled, into which the Guards had been drawn.;['Olsen', 'Temerian', 'Guards'];['Olsen']
26439;Blood of Elves;Geralt got up.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26440;Blood of Elves;'Boatbug,' he said.;['Boatbug'];['Boatbug']
26445;Blood of Elves;'Speaking of problems,' interrupted Olsen, 'just look starboard, Geralt.;['Olsen', 'Geralt'];['Olsen', 'Geralt']
26450;Blood of Elves;Geralt quickly reached into his bag and pulled out both letters -the one from Ciri and the one from Yennefer.;['Geralt', 'Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Geralt', 'Ciri', 'Yennefer']
26455;Blood of Elves;No. Boatbug, take care of my horse.';['Boatbug'];['Boatbug']

26463;Blood of Elves;I will not allow-' 'Olsen,' the witcher interrupted, grabbing him by the sleeve, 'don't interfere, please.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']

26487;Blood of Elves;'I am Geralt, and called Geralt.;['I am Geralt', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']

26523;Blood of Elves;Stran, Vitek!;['Stran', 'Vitek'];['Stran', 'Vitek']
26527;Blood of Elves;Olsen was not perturbed by the yelling and drew out his words slowly and distinctly.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26537;Blood of Elves;'My daddy,' squeaked Everett all of a sudden, appearing at the bald man's side as if from nowhere, 'is a knight!;['Everett'];['Everett']
26547;Blood of Elves;yelled the bald one, shaking Everett, who was squealing like a piglet.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26548;Blood of Elves;'Stran, Vitek, get him!;['Stran', 'Vitek'];['Stran', 'Vitek']
26553;Blood of Elves;'Slaughter him then,' drawled Olsen giving a sign to his men and pulling out his cutlass.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26557;Blood of Elves;Geralt threw his sword on the deck and, with a gesture, held back the customs officers and Boatbug's sailors.;['Geralt', 'Boatbug'];['Geralt', 'Boatbug']
26561;Blood of Elves;The bald man retreated to the side of the barge without letting Everett go, and grabbed a rope.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26562;Blood of Elves;'Vitek, tie him up!;['Vitek'];['Vitek']
26565;Blood of Elves;'Have you lost your mind, Geralt?' growled Olsen.;['Geralt', 'Olsen'];['Geralt', 'Olsen']
26571;Blood of Elves;The bald Guard howled savagely, released Everett, and clung onto the ropes which dangled from the lighter's side.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26572;Blood of Elves;Everett plopped into the already-reddening water.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26574;Blood of Elves;Geralt tore himself away from the two men trying to bind him.;['Geralt', 'two'];['Geralt']
26576;Blood of Elves;The other took a swing at the witcher with an iron hook, but faltered and drooped into Olsen's hands with a cutlass buried to the hilt in his ribs.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26578;Blood of Elves;Before the water - thick with algae - closed in over his head, he heard Linus Pitt, the Lecturer of Natural History at the Academy of Oxenfurt, shout, 'What is that?;['Linus Pitt', 'the Lecturer of Natural History', 'the Academy of Oxenfurt'];['Linus']
26583;Blood of Elves;Geralt, catching hold of the dropped spear, rebounded with his legs against the side of the boat, dived into the seething whirlpool and forcefully jabbed at something, hoping it was not Everett.;['Geralt', 'Everett'];['Geralt', 'Everett']
26592;Blood of Elves;Everett, stirring the water like a little dog, had caught hold of baldy's legs as he was trying to climb on to the lighter by the ropes hanging down the side.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26594;Blood of Elves;Geralt threw himself in their direction and dived.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26596;Blood of Elves;He tore Everett from the entangled algae, swam out on his back and, kicking with his legs, reached the barge.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26597;Blood of Elves;'Here, Geralt!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26603;Blood of Elves;At the same moment, someone else caught Geralt from behind, struck him in the back of the head, covered him over with his bulk and pushed him under the water.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26608;Blood of Elves;The Temerian lighter had already moved a little from the barge and both Geralt and baldy, locked in an embrace, were in between them.;['Temerian', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
26609;Blood of Elves;"Baldy caught Geralt by the throat; the witcher dug a thumb in his eye.";['Baldy', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
26611;Blood of Elves;Geralt could not swim - something was holding him by the leg and dragging him into the depths.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26613;Blood of Elves;"And then he knew what was holding him; the information Linus Pitt yelled from the barge deck was unnecessary.";['Linus Pitt'];['Linus']
26617;Blood of Elves;Geralt violently thrashed his arms in the water, trying to yank his leg from the aeschna's claws as they pulled him towards the rhyth mical snap of its jaws.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26621;Blood of Elves;yelled Olsen.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26628;Blood of Elves;Geralt seized the rope which fell straight onto his face.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26632;Blood of Elves;Leaning over the railings, the dwarf with the fox furs and Olsen were firing their bows.;['Olsen'];['Olsen']
26633;Blood of Elves;Everett, wet and green with algae, his teeth clattering, sobbed in his mother's arms explaining to everybody that he hadn't meanl to do it.;['Everett'];['Everett']
26634;Blood of Elves;'Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26635;Blood of Elves;Boatbug yelled at his ear, 'are you dead?';['Boatbug'];['Boatbug']
26640;Blood of Elves;Nearby, the dwarf released his bowstring and Olsen roared joyously.;['Nearby', 'Olsen'];['Olsen']
26644;Blood of Elves;Hey, Boratek, give him back his money!;['Boratek'];['Boratek']
26655;Blood of Elves;A great discovery!' shouted Linus Pitt, jumping up and down by the barge side.;['Linus Pitt'];['Linus']
26660;Blood of Elves;As Geraltia maxiliosa pitti!' 'Master Tutor,' Geralt groaned, 'if you really want to show me your gratitude, let that damn thing be called Everetia.';"['Geraltia maxiliosa', ""'Master Tutor"", 'Geralt', 'Everetia']";['Geralt']
26664;Blood of Elves;No doubt the only one alive in the Delta-' 'No,' uttered Boatbug suddenly and grimly.;['Delta-', 'Boatbug'];['Boatbug']
26677;Blood of Elves;'May the water be light to him,' said Olsen.;['May', 'Olsen'];['Olsen']
26679;Blood of Elves;'My daddy,' rattled Everett with his teeth, 'can swim faster than that man!';['Everett'];['Everett']
26682;Blood of Elves;Linus Pitt grew pale and turned away.;['Linus Pitt'];['Linus']
26686;Blood of Elves;Geralt sat down heavily on the deck.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26718;Blood of Elves;'Two farthings an hour!';['Two'];['Two']
26721;Blood of Elves;Two people who had been following in his tracks since the town hall stopped at the barber-shop pretending to ponder over the price of the barber's services displayed on a chalkboard.;['Two'];['Two']
26767;Blood of Elves;'Look discreetly over there, Shani.;['Shani'];['Shani']
26772;Blood of Elves;'They've been following me since the market place,' said Dandelion, pretending to embrace and flirt with the medical student.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
26773;Blood of Elves;'Will you do something for me, Shani?';['Shani'];['Shani']
26786;Blood of Elves;Shani's eyes opened wide.;['Shani'];['Shani']
26789;Blood of Elves;Will you do that, Shani?';['Shani'];['Shani']
26795;Blood of Elves;Shani smiled even more beautifully and Dandelion was once more filled with the desire to finally compose a ballad about girls like her - not too pretty but nonetheless beautiful, girls of whom one dreams at night when those of classical beauty are forgotten after five minutes.;['Shani', 'Dandelion', 'one', 'night', 'five minutes'];['Shani', 'Dandelion']
26796;Blood of Elves;'Thank you, Shani.';['Shani'];['Shani']
26797;Blood of Elves;'It's nothing, Dandelion.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
26803;Blood of Elves;Two people lurked around a corner in the lane, by the flowerbed with a bronze bust of the first chancellor of the Academy, Nicodemus de Boot.;['Two', 'first', 'the Academy', 'Nicodemus'];['Two', 'Nicodemus']
26842;Blood of Elves;One of these was, as usual, Ori Reuven, the aged and eternally sniffing secretary to the chief of Redanian spies.;['One', 'Ori Reuven', 'Redanian'];['Ori']
26846;Blood of Elves;Or maybe you'd like to make use of this privilege, Philippa?';['Philippa'];['Philippa']
26859;Blood of Elves;Why didn't you inform me about your ambush, Dandelion?;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
26861;Blood of Elves;'I didn't know anything about Geralt's plans,' Dandelion lied with conviction.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26870;Blood of Elves;Instead of chasing Rience, he decided to wait for Rience to find him.;['Rience'];['Rience']
26873;Blood of Elves;He knew that the Company would advertise it far and wide, that Rience would hear of it and then venture to try something.;['Company', 'Rience'];['Rience']
26879;Blood of Elves;Isn't that right, Philippa?';['Philippa'];['Philippa']
26888;Blood of Elves;Philippa Eilhart, although very attractive, was decidedly very unlikeable.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
26889;Blood of Elves;Apart from that, Philippa Eilhart was an important figure in the Council of Wizards, and King Vizimir's trusted court magician.;"['Philippa Eilhart', 'the Council of Wizards', ""King Vizimir's""]";['Philippa']
26896;Blood of Elves;Ori Reuven coughed, sniffed and wriggled, constantly adjusting his generous toga.;['Ori Reuven'];['Ori']
26918;Blood of Elves;Philippa Eilhart raised her hand.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
26930;Blood of Elves;Go straight to Geralt and bring him here, to the faculty.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26934;Blood of Elves;Bring him to me, Dandelion.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
26936;Blood of Elves;'Geralt has left,' the bard lied calmly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26945;Blood of Elves;'There might be a few difficulties,' Dandelion grimaced, 'in convincing Geralt to come here.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26962;Blood of Elves;They weren't Rience's men.';['Rience'];['Rience']
26967;Blood of Elves;So a few crafty dogs tried to grab Geralt, bury him in some cave and then sell him to Rience, dictating their conditions and trying to bargain as much out of him as possible.;['Geralt', 'Rience'];['Geralt', 'Rience']
26978;Blood of Elves;You say Geralt has left?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
26995;Blood of Elves;Namely, that Geralt, the witcher from Rivia, can answer all kinds of questions if he's asked in the right manner.;['Geralt', 'Rivia'];['Geralt']
27002;Blood of Elves;'Don't make me laugh, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27003;Blood of Elves;'Yet,' Philippa Eilhart said suddenly, 'perhaps he can?;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
27006;Blood of Elves;Where is the child seen with Geralt in Kaedwen?;['Geralt', 'Kaedwen'];['Geralt']
27012;Blood of Elves;Where did Yennefer go when she received Geralt's letter?;['Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']
27014;Blood of Elves;Dijkstra did not stir, but his swift glance at the magician showed Dandelion that the spy was taken aback.;['Dijkstra', 'Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27015;Blood of Elves;The questions Philippa had raised had clearly been asked too soon.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27018;Blood of Elves;The trouble was that Philippa Eilhart could be accused of anything but rashness and carelessness.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
27022;Blood of Elves;Philippa looked him straight in the eyes.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27030;Blood of Elves;And Geralt-' 'Geralt,' interrupted Dijkstra, 'never confided in you, never said a word even though, no doubt, you inundated him with questions.;['Geralt-', 'Geralt', 'Dijkstra'];['Geralt']
27031;Blood of Elves;Why do you think that might be, Dandelion?;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27033;Blood of Elves;Leave him alone, Philippa, it's a waste of time.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27065;Blood of Elves;My regards, Philippa.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27088;Blood of Elves;Not spotting anything suspicious, he climbed the ladder to the thatch and leaped onto the roof of the house belonging to Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard, a brewer he knew.;['Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard'];['Wolfgang']
27091;Blood of Elves;Perched precariously on the guttering, Dandelion knocked on the lead frames.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27093;Blood of Elves;'Geralt!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27094;Blood of Elves;Hey, Geralt!' 'Dandelion?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27102;Blood of Elves;'Geralt ...' he panted and immediately fell silent.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27111;Blood of Elves;And Shani covered herself, yanking the sheet right up to her upturned nose.;['Shani'];['Shani']
27113;Blood of Elves;Geralt reached for his trousers.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27118;Blood of Elves;The witcher gathered Shani's clothes and his own from the floor.;['Shani'];['Shani']
27122;Blood of Elves;'What's this about, Dandelion?';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27128;Blood of Elves;Geralt cleared his throat.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27129;Blood of Elves;'Shani told me about the snoops following you.;['Shani'];['Shani']
27139;Blood of Elves;'They're not concerned about Rience any more, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27140;Blood of Elves;They're after the girl and Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
27158;Blood of Elves;Geralt reached for his sword.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27159;Blood of Elves;'Don't be silly, Philippa,' said Dandelion.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27163;Blood of Elves;'Introduce me, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27167;Blood of Elves;This is Philippa Eilhart from the Council of Wizards, at present in King Vizimir's service and pride of the Tretogor court.;"['Philippa Eilhart', 'the Council of Wizards', ""King Vizimir's"", 'Tretogor']";['Philippa']
27170;Blood of Elves;The enchantress made herself comfortable in the high-backed chair vacated by Dandelion, and cast a smouldering glance over those present, fixing her eyes somewhat longer on Shani.;['Shani'];['Shani']
27171;Blood of Elves;The medical student, to Dandelion's surprise, suddenly blushed.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
27172;Blood of Elves;'In principle, what I've come about is the sole concern of Geralt of Rivia,' Philippa began after a short pause.;['Geralt of Rivia', 'Philippa'];['Geralt', 'Philippa']
27174;Blood of Elves;'I can leave,' said Shani hesitantly.;['Shani'];['Shani']
27175;Blood of Elves;'You can't,' muttered Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27184;Blood of Elves;As our mutual friend says, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27185;Blood of Elves;You're studying medicine, are you, Shani?;['Shani'];['Shani']
27188;Blood of Elves;'Ah,' Philippa Eilhart was looking not at her but at the witcher, 'seventeen, what a beautiful age.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
27189;Blood of Elves;Yennefer would give a lot to be that age again.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
27190;Blood of Elves;What do you reckon, Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27217;Blood of Elves;Dandelion wondered whether he really did understand, because he knew that Philippa was lying through her teeth.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27218;Blood of Elves;'So I see,' said Geralt slowly, proving that he understood perfectly well, 'that the Council of Wizards is also interested in my ward.;['Geralt', 'the Council of Wizards'];['Geralt']
27221;Blood of Elves;Why, Philippa?;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27232;Blood of Elves;Careful, Geralt, or your arrogance will be the end of you.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27237;Blood of Elves;For a moment Dandelion thought the witcher was going to mention the role undertaken by Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
27238;Blood of Elves;He would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27239;Blood of Elves;But Geralt said nothing.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27250;Blood of Elves;If she comes to any misfortune, the responsibility falls on you, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
27256;Blood of Elves;What does the Council of Wizards want from Ciri?;['the Council of Wizards', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
27259;Blood of Elves;What does a certain Rience, who has already murdered three people in Sodden and Temeria who were in touch with me and the girl two years ago, want from her?;['Rience', 'three', 'Sodden', 'Temeria', 'two years ago'];['Rience']
27261;Blood of Elves;Who is this Rience, Philippa?';['Philippa'];['Philippa']
27268;Blood of Elves;In the silence which fell the first drops of rain knocked on the gutter outside the window. would not be risking anything, and would flatten Philippa's arguments.;['first', 'Philippa'];['Philippa']
27269;Blood of Elves;But Geralt said nothing.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

27303;Blood of Elves;Foltest, the Lord of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam and Sodden, and recently Senior Protector of Brugge, presented his noble profile to everyone by turning his head towards the window.;['Foltest', 'Temeria', 'Pontar', 'Mahakam', 'Sodden', 'Brugge'];['Foltest']
27304;Blood of Elves;At the opposite side of the table sat Henselt, King of Kaedwen, running his small, piercing eyes - glistening from a face as bearded as a brigand's - over the other participants of the council.;['Henselt', 'Kaedwen'];['Henselt']
27322;Blood of Elves;'Do not compare us to the elves,' said Henselt of Kaedwen.;['Henselt', 'Kaedwen'];['Henselt']
27332;Blood of Elves;I don't know whether it is true that Emhyr var Emreis was, at the time, against aggression on such a scale, that the attack on Cintra was the work of some party hostile to him - I take it that if they had defeated us, he would be applauding, and distributing privileges and endowments amongst them.;['Emhyr', 'Emreis', 'Cintra'];['Emhyr']
27339;Blood of Elves;I tell you, Emhyr fell into a rage and practically finished off his own commanders.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
27342;Blood of Elves;'It will be young and gifted officers who have long waited for such an opportunity and have been trained by Emhyr for an equally long time.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
27345;Blood of Elves;Those who crushed the uprisings in Metinna and Nazair, who rapidly broke up the rebels in Ebbing.;['Metinna', 'Ebbing'];['Ebbing']
27350;Blood of Elves;'If they have truly learned anything,' Henselt shrugged, 'they will not cross the Yaruga.;['Henselt', 'Yaruga'];['Henselt']
27359;Blood of Elves;'No,' agreed Henselt.;['Henselt'];['Henselt']
27361;Blood of Elves;Without control of the estuary or the shore and with a flank exposed, Emhyr var Emreis will be in no position to ensure provisions reach any detachments he might care to send across the Yaruga.;['Emhyr var Emreis', 'Yaruga'];['Emhyr']
27374;Blood of Elves;'Meve, as usual, does not say much but she hits the nail on the head.;['Meve'];['Meve']

27393;Blood of Elves;'The Scoia'tael,' admitted Henselt, 'have become a real thorn in the backside.;"[""'The Scoia'tael"", 'Henselt']";['Henselt']
27419;Blood of Elves;'All the worries of which we talk,' said Henselt finally, 'is the work of Nilfgaard.;['Henselt', 'Nilfgaard'];['Henselt']
27420;Blood of Elves;It is Emhyr's emissaries who are inciting the non-humans, spreading propaganda and calling for riots.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
27423;Blood of Elves;'It's the same in my country,' agreed Foltest.;['Foltest'];['Foltest']
27439;Blood of Elves;It's a travesty of the prophecy of Ithlinne aep Aevenien, the elven seeress.;['Ithlinne'];['Ithlinne']
27440;Blood of Elves;I gave orders to catch one cleric who was going on about it in the Vengerberg market place and the torturer asked him politely and at length how much gold the prophet had received from Emhyr for doing it ...;['one', 'Vengerberg', 'Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
27445;Blood of Elves;That's exactly what Emhyr is after.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']

27463;Blood of Elves;'Why,' said Meve suddenly, 'are you all looking at me?';['Meve'];['Meve']
27464;Blood of Elves;'We're admiring your beauty,' Henselt mumbled from the depths of his tankard.;['Henselt'];['Henselt']
27466;Blood of Elves;'Meve, we all know you can find a solution to everything.;['Meve'];['Meve']
27470;Blood of Elves;I've never seen a live unicorn, thought Meve.;['Meve'];['Meve']
27491;Blood of Elves;'Nilfgaard is watching and waiting,' continued Meve slowly, toying with her necklace.;['Nilfgaard', 'Meve'];['Meve']
27496;Blood of Elves;Let us shake the walls of this great castle plunged into a winter torpor!' 'Eradicate the Squirrels,' said Henselt quickly.;"['winter', ""'Eradicate the Squirrels"", 'Henselt']";['Henselt']

27553;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz will not back a war.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
27554;Blood of Elves;And the Chapter, believe me, will do whatever Vilgefortz wishes.;['Chapter', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
27555;Blood of Elves;After Sodden he has become the most important person in the Chapter - let other magicians say what they will, Vilgefortz plays first fiddle there.';['Chapter - let', 'Vilgefortz', 'first'];['Vilgefortz']

27558;Blood of Elves;Taking into account Vilgefortz's and the Chapter's plans - plans which I am not acquainted with anyway, and which I do not understand at that - is beginning to annoy me.;['Vilgefortz', 'Chapter'];['Vilgefortz']

27567;Blood of Elves;And when Emhyr var Emreis turns his eyes from Sodden and Transriver, the Cintrians will demand their country back - all those the emigrants and refugees who are gathering themselves in Brugge under Vissegerd's leadership.;['Emhyr var Emreis', 'Sodden', 'Cintrians', 'Brugge', 'Vissegerd'];['Emhyr', 'Vissegerd']
27574;Blood of Elves;'The battle cry,' bore out Meve, 'and the promise that we will back them up.;['Meve'];['Meve']

27577;Blood of Elves;But above all Vissegerd is waiting for the Lion Cub of Cintra.;['Vissegerd', 'the Lion Cub of Cintra'];['Vissegerd']
27583;Blood of Elves;'Nonsense,' said Foltest coldly.;['Foltest'];['Foltest']
27589;Blood of Elves;Obviously, we cannot say that to Vissegerd's emigrants.';['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
27591;Blood of Elves;Meve narrowed her eyes.;['Meve'];['Meve']
27597;Blood of Elves;'Admit it, Foltest,' snapped Henselt.;['Foltest', 'Henselt'];['Foltest', 'Henselt']
27607;Blood of Elves;And yes Venzlav of Brugge paid me homage as a vassal - but without coercion!;['Venzlav', 'Brugge'];['Venzlav']

27765;Blood of Elves;We could, for that matter, hand her over to Vissegerd's guerrillas as a battle standard, tied to a long pole - they could carry her before the front line as they attack the left bank.;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']

27775;Blood of Elves;'Neither Ervyll, nor Niedamir, nor the Thyssens.;['Neither Ervyll', 'Niedamir', 'Thyssens'];['Niedamir']

27778;Blood of Elves;Vissegerd is old and as ugly as cow's dung but with enough decoctions of absinthe and damiana down her throat, the Lion Cub might unexpectedly fall in love with him!;['Vissegerd', 'damiana', 'Lion \r\nCub'];['Vissegerd']

27974;Blood of Elves;Marshal Menno Coehoorn, Governor of the Province of Cintra and future Commander-in-Chief of the Dol Angra army, lifted his head and stood to attention, his hand on the pommel of his sword.;['Menno Coehoorn', 'the Province of Cintra', 'Dol Angra'];['Menno']
27979;Blood of Elves;The way one should wait for orders, the substance and presentation of which were being pondered by the Emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd, the White Flame Dancing on the Grave-Mounds of Enemies.;['Nilfgaard', 'Emhyr var Emreis', 'Deithwen Addan', 'Carn aep Morvudd', 'the White Flame Dancing'];['Emhyr']
27997;Blood of Elves;A dream in which I saw Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28000;Blood of Elves;And Geralt was there.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28008;Blood of Elves;Geralt had stopped short.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28014;Blood of Elves;And where the hell is Philippa?;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
28018;Blood of Elves;Lead on, Shani.;['Shani'];['Shani']
28033;Blood of Elves;Mother Nenneke was speaking quickly, clearly worked up, agitated and angry.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
28042;Blood of Elves;'You really have no heart, Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28043;Blood of Elves;Ciri pricked up her ears, wanting to hear the enchantress's reply, her cold, hard and melodious voice.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
28046;Blood of Elves;But Yennefer answered quietly, so quietly that the girl could neither understand nor even make out the individual words.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28049;Blood of Elves;I'll see what Geralt is doing there, in the night, in the rain, by the canal ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28050;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was holding her by the hand.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28052;Blood of Elves;Ciri could not make out their forms in the thick darkness.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
28055;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was holding her by the hand, walking briskly and assuredly, full of decisiveness, so much so that Ciri could barely keep up with her.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
28060;Blood of Elves;Yennefer did not slow her stride but Ciri suddenly knew that this door would not open of its own accord.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
28064;Blood of Elves;She stopped short, tried to pull away, but Yennefer's hand was strong and unyielding and unrelentingly dragged her forward.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28065;Blood of Elves;And Ciri finally understood that she had been betrayed, deceived, sold out.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
28080;Blood of Elves;Ciri looked around.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
28091;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was sitting beside on the bed.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28092;Blood of Elves;Her head was turned away so that Ciri did not see her face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
28094;Blood of Elves;'I had a dream ...' whispered Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
28099;Blood of Elves;'Damn it,' snarled Dandelion, shaking water from the brim of his hat, soggy from the rain.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
28102;Blood of Elves;'It's the port,' explained Shani.;['Shani'];['Shani']
28105;Blood of Elves;Quite a few people visit Myhrman, bringing money ...;['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28111;Blood of Elves;Geralt looked at the mansion built on stakes dug into the bottom of the canal some ten yards from the shore.;['Geralt', 'some ten \r\nyards'];['Geralt']
28117;Blood of Elves;An enormous grey owl landed soundlessly on the deck's railing, fluttered its wings, ruffled its feathers and turned into Philippa Eilhart, equally ruffled and wet.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
28128;Blood of Elves;This is Myhrman's house?';['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28129;Blood of Elves;'Yes,' confirmed Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28135;Blood of Elves;Two were arguing, tugging, shoving each other and repeatedly swearing the same curses to the point of boredom.;['Two'];['Two']
28140;Blood of Elves;The charlatan Myhrman opened a tiny window and peered out.;['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28149;Blood of Elves;It's me, Shani!';['Shani'];['Shani']
28154;Blood of Elves;How come?' 'Lower the bridge, Master Myhrman!;"[""'Lower"", 'Myhrman']";['Myhrman']
28169;Blood of Elves;Muttering under his breath, Myhrman released the stopper on the winch and the bridge creaked down, hitting the planks of the deck.;['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28174;Blood of Elves;Toublanc Michelet drew the whetstone over the blade of his sword once more, looking totally engrossed in this activity.;['Toublanc Michelet'];['Toublanc']
28180;Blood of Elves;Is that right, honourable Rience?;['Rience'];['Rience']
28189;Blood of Elves;Rizzi, Flavius and Lodovico, as usual, said nothing.;['Flavius', 'Lodovico'];['Flavius', 'Lodovico']
28190;Blood of Elves;In the team they formed, it was they who killed, Toublanc who talked.;['Toublanc'];['Toublanc']
28194;Blood of Elves;'And in order to kill such an ordinary dunce, Master Rience, you're hiring not just any old thug from the port but us, the Michelet brothers?;['Master Rience', 'Michelet'];['Michelet']
28196;Blood of Elves;'Incorrect,' contradicted Toublanc coldly.;['Toublanc'];['Toublanc']
28210;Blood of Elves;Flavius Michelet, moving his leg in a flash, flattened it with a crunch - hardly changing his position and not changing his expression in the least.;['Flavius Michelet'];['Flavius']
28214;Blood of Elves;Toublanc Michelet, professional killer from the age of fourteen, did not betray his surprise with so much as the flicker of an eyelid.;['Toublanc Michelet', 'fourteen'];['Toublanc']
28224;Blood of Elves;Myhrman could not see his face - it was hidden in a darkness not dispersed by the lantern standing on the table.;['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28231;Blood of Elves;'Where's Rience, Myhrman?';"[""'Where's Rience"", 'Myhrman']";['Myhrman']
28242;Blood of Elves;The man bent over and Myhrman saw his face.;['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28245;Blood of Elves;'Don't beat about the bush, Myhrman, don't twist up your tail.';['bush', 'Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28246;Blood of Elves;The familiar voice of Shani, the medical student came from the shadows.;['Shani'];['Shani']
28274;Blood of Elves;Because if Rience were to return and ask why he had betrayed him, Myhrman would have to be able to show him why.;['Rience', 'Myhrman'];['Rience', 'Myhrman']
28289;Blood of Elves;Too soon, Myhrman, too soon.;['Myhrman'];['Myhrman']
28294;Blood of Elves;'And so,' said Vilgefortz, having heard the report, 'our kings have started to think independently.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28301;Blood of Elves;'We know,' confirmed Artaud Terranova.;['Artaud Terranova'];['Artaud']
28305;Blood of Elves;'Thank you for remembering,' smiled the wizard, and Tissaia de Vries was suddenly sure that he had already been aware of each of the facts just presented to him, and had been for a long time.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28308;Blood of Elves;She felt Terranova's unfavourable gaze and Vilgefortz's amused eyes on her.;['Terranova', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28311;Blood of Elves;'What does the Chapter say to all this?' 'First of all,' retorted Terranova, 'we would like to hear your opinion, Vilgefortz.';['Chapter', 'First', 'Terranova', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28316;Blood of Elves;Tissaia de Vries shrugged.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28317;Blood of Elves;'It was nearer for me,' added Artaud.;['Artaud'];['Artaud']
28318;Blood of Elves;'Two proved enough.;['Two'];['Two']
28322;Blood of Elves;Lydia, would you be so kind?';['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28323;Blood of Elves;Lydia van Bredevoort, Vilgefortz's assistant and personal secretary, appeared from behind the curtain like an ethereal phantom and smiled with her eyes at Tissaia de Vries.;['Lydia van Bredevoort', 'Vilgefortz', 'Tissaia de Vries'];['Lydia', 'Vilgefortz', 'Tissaia']
28324;Blood of Elves;Tissaia, controlling her face, replied with a pleasant smile and bow of her head.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
28327;Blood of Elves;He knew Lydia.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28328;Blood of Elves;Two servants, bustling around and rustling their skirts, swiftly lay out the tableware, plates and platters.;['Two'];['Two']
28329;Blood of Elves;Lydia van Bredevoort, delicately conjuring up a tiny flame between her thumb and index finger, lit the candles in the candelabras.;['Lydia van Bredevoort'];['Lydia']
28332;Blood of Elves;Lydia was a talented artist.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28334;Blood of Elves;Artaud Terranova did not stint himself and reached without embarrassment for the platters and - probably a little too frequently, and without his host's encouragement clanged the silver top of the carafe of red wine.;['Artaud Terranova'];['Artaud']
28338;Blood of Elves;Lydia, of course, did not drink or eat at all.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28341;Blood of Elves;'Well, Vilgefortz,' said Terranova finally, rummaging in a platter with his fork in search of an adequately fatty piece of game.;['Vilgefortz', 'Terranova'];['Vilgefortz']
28343;Blood of Elves;Hen Gedymdeith and Francesca sent us here because they want to know your opinion.;['Francesca'];['Francesca']
28348;Blood of Elves;'It flatters me greatly' with a gesture, Vilgefortz thanked Lydia, who was offering to put more broccoli on his plate - 'that my opinion in this matter should be decisive for the Chapter.';['Vilgefortz', 'Lydia', 'Chapter'];['Vilgefortz', 'Lydia']
28350;Blood of Elves;Artaud poured himself some more wine.;['Artaud'];['Artaud']
28355;Blood of Elves;If we've finished supping, let us go through into the workshop, Lydia proposed telepathically, smiling with her eyes.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28359;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz wiped his fingers on a napkin.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28363;Blood of Elves;You can bring the carafe, Artaud.';['Artaud'];['Artaud']
28368;Blood of Elves;All were enveloped in a screening spell, but Tissaia de Vries was an Archmage - there was no screen she could not penetrate.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28375;Blood of Elves;Lydia glanced at Vilgefortz, caught the sign transmitted by his eye and immediately left.;['Lydia', 'Vilgefortz'];['Lydia', 'Vilgefortz']
28377;Blood of Elves;Everyone knew that Lydia van Bredevoort was in love with Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, that she had loved him for years with a silent, relentless and stubborn love.;['Lydia van Bredevoort', 'Vilgefortz of Roggeveen', 'years'];['Lydia']
28379;Blood of Elves;Lydia made it easier for him by never betraying her feelings to him she never took the slightest step or made the slightest gesture, transmitted no sign by thought and, even if she could speak, would never have said a word.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28381;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz, too, did nothing because he did not love Lydia.;['Vilgefortz', 'Lydia'];['Vilgefortz', 'Lydia']
28384;Blood of Elves;But Vilgefortz did not.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28393;Blood of Elves;Artaud Terranova froze with the chalice in his left hand, the carafe in his right.;['Artaud Terranova'];['Artaud']
28396;Blood of Elves;We're to let-' 'We already have,' interrupted Vilgefortz.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28408;Blood of Elves;'Yes, Artaud.';['Artaud'];['Artaud']
28409;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz looked at him and his eyes flashed.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28416;Blood of Elves;The Chapter will do as he says, disguising his order as advice, thought Tissaia de Vries.;['Chapter', 'Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28431;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz turned his head towards her.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28432;Blood of Elves;Now you're going to change tactics, thought Tissaia.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
28436;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz did not lower his eyes from hers.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28438;Blood of Elves;'You are right, Tissaia.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']

28446;Blood of Elves;At the last name Vilgefortz twitched internally.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28447;Blood of Elves;But Tissaia de Vries was an Archmage.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28451;Blood of Elves;Aen Ithlinnespeath, the prophecy foretold by Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien, the elven seeress.;['Aen Ithlinnespeath', 'Ithlinne Aegli', 'Aevenien'];['Aevenien']

28462;Blood of Elves;'I second Vilgefortz's plan.;['second', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']

28469;Blood of Elves;What are you brewing, Vilgefortz?;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28470;Blood of Elves;I'm sorry, said Lydia van Bredevoort telepathically, coming in without a sound.;['Lydia van Bredevoort'];['Lydia']
28475;Blood of Elves;Artaud yawned, muffled a belch and reached for the carafe.;['Artaud'];['Artaud']
28476;Blood of Elves;Tissaia looked at Lydia.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28477;Blood of Elves;Lydia smiled.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28481;Blood of Elves;Four years ago, on Vilgefortz's - her master's - recommendation, Lydia had taken part in experiments concerning the properties of an artefact found amongst the excavations of an ancient necropolis.;['Four years ago', 'Vilgefortz', 'Lydia'];['Vilgefortz', 'Lydia']
28486;Blood of Elves;Lydia escaped with burns, a mangled jaw and a mutation of the larynx and throat which, to this day, effectively resisted all efforts at regeneration.;['Lydia', 'this day'];['Lydia']
28487;Blood of Elves;A powerful illusion was therefore drawn so that people did not faint at the sight of Lydia's face.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28491;Blood of Elves;'Thank you, Lydia.';['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28492;Blood of Elves;Lydia smiled.;['Lydia'];['Lydia']
28498;Blood of Elves;Tissaia, Artaud, I apologise for the short delay.;['Tissaia', 'Artaud'];['Tissaia', 'Artaud']
28501;Blood of Elves;Nowhere, thought Tissaia de Vries.;['Nowhere', 'Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28504;Blood of Elves;'Ah,' began Vilgefortz slowly.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28508;Blood of Elves;Fercart and Yennefer.;['Fercart', 'Yennefer'];['Fercart', 'Yennefer']
28509;Blood of Elves;Fercart, as far as I know, is tied to Foltest of Temeria and sits on the king's council with Triss Merigold.;"['Fercart', 'Foltest', 'Temeria', ""the king's council"", 'Merigold']";['Fercart', 'Foltest']
28510;Blood of Elves;But who is Yennefer tied to?;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28511;Blood of Elves;You said, Artaud, that she is one of those who are serving kings.';['Artaud'];['Artaud']
28512;Blood of Elves;'Artaud exaggerated,' said Tissaia calmly.;['Artaud', 'Tissaia'];['Artaud', 'Tissaia']
28513;Blood of Elves;'Yennefer is living in Vengerberg so Demawend sometimes turns to her for help, but they do not work together all the time.;['Yennefer', 'Vengerberg'];['Yennefer']
28525;Blood of Elves;Stone, metal, crystal, thought Tissaia de Vries.;['Stone', 'Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
28526;Blood of Elves;'Everything that Yennefer wears is active and cannot be detected using psychic visions.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28528;Blood of Elves;If Yennefer does not wish anyone to know where she is, no one will find out.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28532;Blood of Elves;And Yennefer, wherever she is, will reply.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28534;Blood of Elves;'Yennefer,' threw in Artaud, 'frequently disappears, sometimes for entire months.;['Yennefer', 'Artaud', 'entire months'];['Yennefer', 'Artaud']
28538;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz smiled faintly.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28543;Blood of Elves;Geralt, if I'm not mistaken.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28545;Blood of Elves;It appeared Yennefer was quite strongly involved ...' Tissaia de Vries sat up straight and gripped the armrests of her chair.;['Yennefer', 'Tissaia de Vries'];['Yennefer', 'Tissaia']
28550;Blood of Elves;Vilgefortz glanced at the letter lying discarded on the pulpit.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
28553;Blood of Elves;I am wondering about Yennefer's reaction to the news of ... of Geralt's death.;['Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']
28555;Blood of Elves;'No doubt, she would,' said Tissaia coldly.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
28558;Blood of Elves;'This Geralt, or whatever he's called, knows how to fend for himself.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28561;Blood of Elves;And as for Yennefer, let us not exaggerate her alleged emotions.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28592;Blood of Elves;And I know where to find that witch of yours, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28621;Blood of Elves;Geralt did not parry and, whirling in a pirouette, came between them.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28640;Blood of Elves;Geralt parried at the last moment, statically, without a turn, with a quarte from dextra.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28643;Blood of Elves;Geralt was already spinning.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28646;Blood of Elves;Geralt slipped out of the half-turn just beside him, very close.;['Geralt', 'half'];['Geralt']
28653;Blood of Elves;He heard Shani's terrified scream as she tried to pull herself free of Dandelion on the bridge leading to the charlatan's house.;['Shani'];['Shani']
28655;Blood of Elves;Geralt grasped his sword with both hands and without second thoughts ran towards him.;['Geralt', 'second'];['Geralt']
28658;Blood of Elves;But Geralt understood.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28659;Blood of Elves;He knew that Rience was calling for help.;['Rience'];['Rience']
28664;Blood of Elves;Geralt jumped.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

28682;Blood of Elves;I beg you, Shani, don't look.';['Shani'];['Shani']
28719;Blood of Elves;Toublanc Michelet, professional murderer since the age of fourteen, closed his eyes and smiled a bloodied smile.;['Toublanc Michelet', 'the age of', 'fourteen'];['Toublanc']
28726;Blood of Elves;Having already thrown his sword aside, his hands were free and his fingers, extended in a leap, dug into the edge of Rience's cloak.;['Rience'];['Rience']
28730;Blood of Elves;Geralt spun him round by hitting him in the shoulder with his right hand, then immediately struck him in the neck under the ear with his left.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28739;Blood of Elves;'You've already received a present from Yennefer,' he uttered in a hoarse voice.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
28743;Blood of Elves;Geralt was slightly surprised - he had not felt any pain but had, no doubt, been injured in the fight.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28757;Blood of Elves;Geralt buried his knees in the sorcerer's chest, raised his arm, forming the Sign of Aard with his fingers, and aimed at the flaming portal.;['Geralt', 'the Sign of Aard'];['Geralt']
28760;Blood of Elves;Only power radiated from it and Rience had taken the power.;['Rience'];['Rience']
28762;Blood of Elves;They dug into Geralt's chest and shoulder with an audible crack.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
28768;Blood of Elves;Geralt, catching his breath with difficulty, drew a stiletto from his boot.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

28777;Blood of Elves;Some ten paces behind him stood Philippa Eilhart.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']

28987;Blood of Elves;'Mother Nenneke asked the greeve the same thing,' declared Iola the Second. ';['Mother Nenneke', 'Iola the Second'];['Iola']
29001;Blood of Elves;'Not all of us,' said Eurneid scathingly.;['Eurneid'];['Eurneid']
29006;Blood of Elves;You know who I'm talking about, Ciri, don't you?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29007;Blood of Elves;'Ciri will leave for the war no doubt,' giggled Iola the Second.;['Ciri', 'Iola the Second'];['Ciri', 'Iola']
29012;Blood of Elves;Eurneid wrinkled her little nose.;['Eurneid'];['Eurneid']
29020;Blood of Elves;'Magic isn't for show,' said Ciri angrily.;['Magic', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
29025;Blood of Elves;It's exactly as if I were hearing that hag Yennefer talk!';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29026;Blood of Elves;'Ciri is getting more and more like her,' appraised Iola, sniffing ostentatiously.;['Iola'];['Iola']
29029;Blood of Elves;Do you use magical scents, Ciri?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29033;Blood of Elves;Eurneid twisted her lips.;['Eurneid'];['Eurneid']
29043;Blood of Elves;'That's the way it is!' squeaked Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29055;Blood of Elves;yelled Ciri and threw the basket of grain on the ground.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29058;Blood of Elves;Ciri cursed loudly, repeating a favourite saying of Vesemir's which she did not entirely understand.;['Ciri', 'Vesemir'];['Ciri', 'Vesemir']
29059;Blood of Elves;Then she added a few words she had heard Yarpen Zigrin use, the meanings of which were a total mystery to her.;['Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
29065;Blood of Elves;'Jarre!';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29067;Blood of Elves;'Jarre, are you there?;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29078;Blood of Elves;Ciri slipped her thumbs into her belt and tossed her ashen fringe.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29087;Blood of Elves;'War?' mumbled Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29096;Blood of Elves;'No.' 'Hmm ... Or Mother Nenneke?' Ciri pulled a face.;['Mother Nenneke', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
29098;Blood of Elves;The sixteen-year-old Jarre was the high priestess's ward, being prepared by her to be a cleric and chronicler.;['sixteen-year-old', 'Jarre'];['Jarre']
29100;Blood of Elves;Ciri had never heard it from Nenneke's lips but it was well known that the high priestess absolutely did not want Jarre to hang around her young novices.;['Ciri', 'Nenneke', 'Jarre'];['Ciri', 'Nenneke', 'Jarre']
29103;Blood of Elves;Ciri was amazed because Jarre was the exact opposite of everything which, in her eyes, should represent an attractive male.;['Ciri', 'Jarre'];['Ciri', 'Jarre']
29106;Blood of Elves;Ciri had also seen a number of different men the wise and gentle druids of Angren, the tall and gloomy settlers of Sodden, the witchers of Kaer Morhen.;['Ciri', 'Angren', 'Sodden', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Ciri']
29107;Blood of Elves;Jarre was different.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29109;Blood of Elves;Truly, Ciri did not understand why she was so drawn to Jarre's tower.;['Ciri', 'Jarre'];['Ciri', 'Jarre']
29122;Blood of Elves;Don't twist things, Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29127;Blood of Elves;'Oh, Jarre, tell me, please!;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29130;Blood of Elves;Please, Jarre!';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29132;Blood of Elves;Ciri sighed surreptitiously.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29133;Blood of Elves;'Hmm ...' Jarre shuffled from foot to foot and moved his arms undecidedly, evidently not knowing what to do with them.;['Hmm', 'Jarre'];['Jarre']
29145;Blood of Elves;'I study historical treatises,' Jarre turned crimson, 'and one can learn more from them than sitting on a council.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29149;Blood of Elves;'Of course,' lied Ciri, picking a blade of grass from the buckle of her shoe.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29152;Blood of Elves;Ciri did not reply.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29156;Blood of Elves;Jarre was worried.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29162;Blood of Elves;'I do, but they're hidden in the chest,' said the boy quickly, but seeing Ciri pull a face, he sighed, pushed the scrolls of parchment off the chest, lifted the lid and started to rummage through the contents.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29163;Blood of Elves;Ciri, wriggling in the chair and swinging her legs, carried on flicking through the book.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29167;Blood of Elves;Jarre, walking up with an enormous scroll under his arm, blushed violently, took the etching from her without a word and hid it under the papers strewn across the table.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29185;Blood of Elves;Ciri finally weighed down one corner with a chair leg and Jarre pressed another down with a hefty book entitled The Life and Deeds of Great King Radovid.;['Ciri', 'one', 'Jarre', 'The Life and Deeds of Great King Radovid'];['Ciri', 'Jarre']
29215;Blood of Elves;Jarre scratched the wart on his chin.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29229;Blood of Elves;Ciri slapped the map with her open palm.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29230;Blood of Elves;Well, Jarre, tell me about the war.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29249;Blood of Elves;"This huge white mark?' Jarre moved closer; she felt the warmth of his knee.";['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29261;Blood of Elves;'Ciri, I ' 'I came to you with a serious matter, as a wizard to a scholar,' she said icily and with dignity, in a tone of voice which exactly copied that of Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29268;Blood of Elves;'That time,' hawked Jarre, wiping the sweat which had all of a sudden appeared on his brow, 'they only had Brugge, Sodden and Temeria against them.;['Jarre', 'Brugge', 'Sodden', 'Temeria'];['Jarre']
29272;Blood of Elves;Temeria, Redania, Aedirn and Kaedwen ...' 'Kaedwen,' said Ciri proudly.;['Temeria', 'Redania', 'Aedirn', 'Kaedwen', 'Kaedwen', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
29279;Blood of Elves;She broke off, recalling that Geralt had forbidden her to mention the events in Kaedwen.;['Geralt', 'Kaedwen'];['Geralt']
29280;Blood of Elves;Jarre stared at her suspiciously.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29295;Blood of Elves;'If there was fighting,' frowned Ciri, 'there's a war already!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29297;Blood of Elves;'It's not the first time there's been fighting,' clarified Jarre, but the girl saw that he was less and less sure of himself.;['first', 'Jarre'];['Jarre']
29310;Blood of Elves;Jarre, tell me-';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29319;Blood of Elves;'Listen, Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29323;Blood of Elves;Jarre also stood up.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29331;Blood of Elves;Take care, Jarre.';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29337;Blood of Elves;Ciri sighed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29340;Blood of Elves;She could have broken her legs on the stool standing in her way but Ciri jumped over it deftly, gracefully executed a half-pirouette feigning the slash of a sword, and joyfully laughed at her successful trick.;['Ciri', 'half'];['Ciri']
29348;Blood of Elves;The enchantress did not look round, did not turn away from the table, looked at Ciri in the mirror.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29353;Blood of Elves;Yennefer sat motionless, staring at the window and toying with her comb.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29354;Blood of Elves;Ciri snorted, spluttered and spat because soap had got into her mouth.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29358;Blood of Elves;Ciri knew that Yennefer had been waiting for them a long time and that the day on which they were to leave the Temple depended on her receiving these letters.;['Yennefer', 'the day', 'Temple'];['Yennefer']
29359;Blood of Elves;In spite of what she had told Jarre, the girl had no idea where and why they were leaving.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29361;Blood of Elves;'Don't you even dare,' said Yennefer, without turning around.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29364;Blood of Elves;'I thought one of them might be from Geralt ...';['one', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
29370;Blood of Elves;Ciri obeyed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29371;Blood of Elves;Yennefer smiled faintly.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29387;Blood of Elves;When you visit Jarre I hope there aren't any problems with your memory either?';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29388;Blood of Elves;Ciri lowered her eyes, but only momentarily.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29389;Blood of Elves;Yennefer did not smile.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29392;Blood of Elves;No splashing, please.' Wrapped in a towel, Ciri sat down on the small chair at the magician's knees.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29393;Blood of Elves;Yennefer brushed the girl's hair, every now and again snipping off a disobedient wisp with a pair of scissors.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29399;Blood of Elves;But Nenneke doesn't like it.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29402;Blood of Elves;I don't care about Jarre in the least.';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29403;Blood of Elves;Ciri blushed a little.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29411;Blood of Elves;Yennefer stopped combing Ciri's hair and measured her with a deep, violet gaze.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
29421;Blood of Elves;'I remember,' repeated Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29430;Blood of Elves;'Indeed,' the magician confirmed coolly, snipping her scissors just above Ciri's ear.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29435;Blood of Elves;'Jarre said ... that there's not going to be a war with Nilfgaard.;['Jarre', 'Nilfgaard'];['Jarre']
29440;Blood of Elves;Jarre reads various learned books and knows it all, but I think ...';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
29441;Blood of Elves;'It interests me, what you think, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29444;Blood of Elves;Lady Yennefer, my grandmother was much cleverer than Jarre.;['Lady Yennefer', 'Jarre'];['Jarre']
29449;Blood of Elves;Ciri raised her head and her voice stuck in her throat.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29450;Blood of Elves;Yennefer put her arms around her and hugged her tightly.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29460;Blood of Elves;Ciri sniffed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29467;Blood of Elves;I don't want to lose Geralt ... or you, Lady Yennefer.;['Geralt', 'Lady Yennefer'];['Geralt']
29478;Blood of Elves;Ciri sniffed again.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29479;Blood of Elves;Yennefer coughed quietly, put down the scissors and comb, got to her feet and crossed over to the window.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29484;Blood of Elves;Ciri did not say anything.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29488;Blood of Elves;Hrosvitha was showing us plants and herbs.;['Hrosvitha'];['Hrosvitha']
29489;Blood of Elves;Then Iola the First came in and whispered something in Hrosvitha's ear.;['First', 'Hrosvitha'];['Hrosvitha']
29492;Blood of Elves;'Get yourself together, Ciri,' she said, 'and go the refectory, quick.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29493;Blood of Elves;Mother Nenneke is summoning you.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29497;Blood of Elves;Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29499;Blood of Elves;Quick, Ciri, hurry up.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29502;Blood of Elves;I knew immediately, thought Ciri, that it was her.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29510;Blood of Elves;Ciri sighed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29511;Blood of Elves;Yennefer turned and the obsidian star on her neck glittered with a thousand reflections.;['Yennefer', 'obsidian', 'thousand'];['Yennefer']
29514;Blood of Elves;'Ciri,' said Nenneke, 'come closer.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29520;Blood of Elves;The enchantress, rustling her long, black dress, approached, took Ciri by the chin and quite off-handedly lifted her head, turning it right and left.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29523;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was very beautiful.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29526;Blood of Elves;Ciri suddenly felt ashamed, ashamed of her grazed elbows, chapped hands, broken nails, her ashen, stringy hair.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29527;Blood of Elves;All of a sudden, she had an overwhelming desire to possess what Yennefer had - a beautiful, exposed neck and on it a lovely black velvet ribbon with a lovely glittering star.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29534;Blood of Elves;Ciri shuddered and hunched her shoulders.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29535;Blood of Elves;No, she did not envy Yennefer that one thing - did not desire to have it or even look at it.;['Yennefer', 'one'];['Yennefer']
29540;Blood of Elves;'Yes, Nenneke,' she said.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29552;Blood of Elves;'Tall for her age,' continued the magician, still appraising Ciri with her eyes.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29555;Blood of Elves;Yennefer did not take her eyes off her.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29566;Blood of Elves;Yennefer gathered the hair from her cheek.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29578;Blood of Elves;Nenneke looked at her coldly and, all of a sudden, somehow oddly without respect.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29584;Blood of Elves;Yennefer pursed her lips.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29588;Blood of Elves;"Ciri could barely keep her hands from shaking; she swallowed hard and looked inquiringly at Nenneke.";['Ciri', 'Nenneke'];['Ciri', 'Nenneke']
29592;Blood of Elves;Ciri bowed her head and clenched her teeth.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29593;Blood of Elves;'You are no doubt baffled,' continued Nenneke, 'that a Mistress of Wizardry is suddenly taking you into her care.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29601;Blood of Elves;Let us go, girl.' 'Go,' nodded Nenneke, trying, in vain, to make her smile at least appear natural.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29606;Blood of Elves;I'll escape tonight, Ciri made up her mind.;['tonight', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
29614;Blood of Elves;'Nothing, nothing,' smiled Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29617;Blood of Elves;Just look at this ward of yours, Nenneke.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29628;Blood of Elves;'She's not your rival, Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29629;Blood of Elves;For a moment they measured each other with their eyes, the enchantress and the priestess, and Ciri felt the air quiver, a strange, terrible force between them growing in strength.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29630;Blood of Elves;This lasted no more than a fraction of a second after which the force disappeared and Yennefer burst out laughing, lightheartedly and sweetly.;['second', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29632;Blood of Elves;'Always on his side, aren't you, Nenneke?;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29638;Blood of Elves;Once again, Ciri felt fury rise up somewhere in the pit of her stomach, and her temples throbbed with spite and rebellion.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29640;Blood of Elves;Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29647;Blood of Elves;They're talking about Geralt in front of me, in my presence, but they can't because I ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
29650;Blood of Elves;'You, on the other hand, Nenneke,' retorted the magician, 'are amusing yourself, as usual, analysing other people's emotions, and on top of that interpreting them to suit yourself!';['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29653;Blood of Elves;Yennefer tossed her black locks, which gleamed and writhed like snakes.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29660;Blood of Elves;She smiled at Ciri and, despite herself, despite her anger and annoyance, Ciri had to respond with a smile.;['Ciri', 'Ciri'];['Ciri', 'Ciri']
29663;Blood of Elves;She listened to Yennefer's speech with her back ostentatiously turned, pretending to bestow her full attention on the bumble bee buzzing in the flower of one of the hollyhocks growing by the temple wall.;['Yennefer', 'one'];['Yennefer']
29666;Blood of Elves;Ciri turned in a half-pirouette and furiously whacked the hollyhock with her fist.;['Ciri', 'half'];['Ciri']
29668;Blood of Elves;"'No one asked me whether I wanted you to teach me!' Yennefer rested her fists on her hips; her eyes flashed.";['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29678;Blood of Elves;Ciri experienced a throbbing in her temples and a buzzing in her ears, as if she were swallowing but much louder.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29680;Blood of Elves;Yennefer lowered her hand and the sensation instantly passed.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29687;Blood of Elves;Not in front of Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
29711;Blood of Elves;I'm destined for Geralt ...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
29715;Blood of Elves;'You are persistently staring at my neckline,' said Yennefer icily, narrowing her violet eyes a little.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29717;Blood of Elves;'That star ...' muttered Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29725;Blood of Elves;No!' Ciri backed away and angrily tossed her head, trying to dispel the faint scent of lilac and gooseberries emanating from Yennefer.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
29736;Blood of Elves;and anyway,' concluded Ciri, 'I've got to think about it.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29742;Blood of Elves;Yennefer nodded, still gazing at her nails.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29748;Blood of Elves;Ciri leaped to her feet, snorted and stamped.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29758;Blood of Elves;Yennefer looked her in the eyes and Ciri shrivelled under the gaze.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
29768;Blood of Elves;Yennefer's voice changed imperceptibly.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29776;Blood of Elves;'I don't understand anything any more,' said Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29793;Blood of Elves;They were alone in the large chamber next to the library in an unoccupied side wing of the building, which Nenneke had allocated to the lady magician.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
29795;Blood of Elves;She knew that Geralt, whenever he visited the Temple, stayed right here.;['Geralt', 'Temple'];['Geralt']
29800;Blood of Elves;'So I'll leave alone,' said Yennefer coldly, untying the straps of her saddle-bags.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29808;Blood of Elves;Ciri heard her curse under her breath while smiling, and saw her hide the finds back in the drawers.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29822;Blood of Elves;Ciri nodded and cast a fleeting glance of her green eyes at the magician.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29823;Blood of Elves;'Secondly,' continued Yennefer, unpacking her saddle-bags, '1 will demand absolute sincerity.;['Secondly', 'Yennefer', '1'];['Yennefer']
29829;Blood of Elves;'Yes,' muttered Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29834;Blood of Elves;Yennefer looked at her and her lips twisted strangely.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29847;Blood of Elves;'What is there between you and Geralt, Lady Yennefer?';['Geralt', 'Lady Yennefer'];['Geralt']
29859;Blood of Elves;Ciri bridled.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29861;Blood of Elves;Yennefer smiled with the corners of her lips.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29863;Blood of Elves;Ciri, annoyed, pulled herself up straight and wriggled in her hard chair which, after many hours of sitting, hurt her backside.;['Ciri', 'many hours'];['Ciri']
29872;Blood of Elves;Yennefer raised her eyebrows.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29902;Blood of Elves;'Because Iola, Myrrha, Eurneid and Katye - when we were having dinner - laughed at me and said that witchcraft doesn't have access to me and that I'm not going to perform any magic because ...;['Myrrha', 'Eurneid', 'Katye'];['Myrrha', 'Eurneid']
29909;Blood of Elves;repeated Ciri aggressively.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29912;Blood of Elves;'I can't see a solution,' Yennefer leaned back in her chair.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29924;Blood of Elves;'Pine trees are silly,' decreed Ciri, sticking out her tongue and drawing a slightly crooked tree with her charcoal.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29943;Blood of Elves;'How many?' 'Three!' Yennefer did not say anything for a long time.;['Three', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29945;Blood of Elves;The mischievous smile on Ciri's lips started slowly to disappear until finally it disappeared altogether, without a trace.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29960;Blood of Elves;'Look at me, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29963;Blood of Elves;'Ciri,' said Yennefer.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
29978;Blood of Elves;Staring at it was as dull as dish-water and Ciri kept falling asleep.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29979;Blood of Elves;Yennefer, surprisingly, did not care even though a few days earlier she had scolded her grimly for napping over one of the cockroach blots.;['Yennefer', 'a few days earlier'];['Yennefer']
29981;Blood of Elves;She missed movement and fresh air and, obliged to be sincere, she immediately told Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29985;Blood of Elves;Unlike the training in Kaer Morhen, though, the exercises with Yennefer were always accompanied by theory.;['Kaer Morhen', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
29986;Blood of Elves;The magician taught Ciri how to breathe, guiding the movement of her chest and diaphragm with strong pressure frorn her hand.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
29988;Blood of Elves;During one such session of relaxation, stretched out on the grass and gazing at the sky, Ciri asked a question which was bothering her.;['one', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
30024;Blood of Elves;Ciri hastened her horse, followed in Yennefer's tracks and caught up with her.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
30026;Blood of Elves;'Magic,' Yennefer continued after a while, 'is, in some people's opinion, art.;['Magic', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30048;Blood of Elves;Yennefer approached the monolith, placed her palm on the coarse surface of the stone and carefully brushed away the dust and dry leaves.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30064;Blood of Elves;Ciri heard a dull, distant noise and a rumble coming from within the earth.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30087;Blood of Elves;And you will learn it, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30101;Blood of Elves;Ciri trembled with cold and dread.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30109;Blood of Elves;Look at my star, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30116;Blood of Elves;Yennefer's lips, cut and crushed, move silently, flow with blood.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30131;Blood of Elves;Yennefer's voice seems to come from somewhere afar, is dull, awakens echoes amidst the stone walls dripping with damp.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30147;Blood of Elves;'Let's go,' says Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
30185;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was kneeling next to her.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30188;Blood of Elves;'Mama ...' groaned Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30211;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was firm, frequently stern, sometimes masterfully formidable.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30213;Blood of Elves;Previously, Ciri could barely keep her eyes open in the Temple school and would sometimes even doze off during a lesson, lulled by the monotonous, gentle voice of Nenneke, Iola the First, Hrosvitha or some other teacher.;['Ciri', 'Nenneke', 'First', 'Hrosvitha'];['Ciri', 'Nenneke', 'Hrosvitha']
30214;Blood of Elves;With Yennefer, it was impossible.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30219;Blood of Elves;Ciri spent most of the day with Yennefer.;['Ciri', 'the day', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
30223;Blood of Elves;Ciri slept deeply.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30226;Blood of Elves;Yennefer sighed in resignation and, ruffling her black hair with both hands, lowered her head.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30229;Blood of Elves;Ciri turned away, mumbled something in a raspy voice and massaged her stiff hand.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30245;Blood of Elves;'Not so loud, Ciri, otherwise Nenneke will come running again, thinking that I'm skinning you alive or frying you in oil.;['Ciri', 'Nenneke'];['Ciri', 'Nenneke']
30259;Blood of Elves;Geralt has been brandishing his sword for his whole life and his fingers are agile and;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
30272;Blood of Elves;Ciri, why aren't you using the ointment I gave you?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30277;Blood of Elves;'But I won the ring from Myrrha playing spinning tops!;['Myrrha'];['Myrrha']
30286;Blood of Elves;It's important, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30291;Blood of Elves;Is that because I'm ... a virgin?' 'Ugly one,' Yennefer smiled and stroked her on the head, 'are you still obsessed with that?;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30300;Blood of Elves;'Too bad,' sighed Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30309;Blood of Elves;Ciri blushed a deep shade of crimson.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30311;Blood of Elves;'It's easy to tell,' said Yennefer, naturally.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30325;Blood of Elves;Ciri's emerald eyes turned the shape and size of saucers.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30335;Blood of Elves;I'm not joking, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30339;Blood of Elves;After mastering the basic positions of the hands, the moves and gestures, Ciri began to learn spells and their formulae.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30343;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was clearly pleased and, from day to day, was becoming more pleasant and sympathetic.;['Yennefer', 'from day to day'];['Yennefer']
30344;Blood of Elves;"More and more frequently, taking breaks in the studies, both gossiped and joked about any old thing; both even began to amuse themselves by delicately poking fun at Nenneke who often 'visited' their lectures and exercises - bristling and puffed up like a brooding hen - ready to take Ciri under her protective wing, to protect and save her from the magician's imagined severity and the 'inhuman tortures' of her education.";['Nenneke', 'Ciri'];['Nenneke', 'Ciri']
30345;Blood of Elves;Obeying instructions, Ciri moved to Yennefer's chamber.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
30351;Blood of Elves;Ciri waded through Stammelford's Dialogues on the Nature of Magic, Giambattista's Forces of the Elements and Richert and Monck's Natural Magic.;['Ciri', 'Stammelford', 'Giambattista', 'Forces of the Elements and Richert', 'Monck'];['Ciri', 'Giambattista']
30352;Blood of Elves;She also flicked through - because she did not manage to read them in their entirety such works as Jan Bekker's The Invisible World and Agnes of Glanville's The Secret of Secrets.;"[""Jan Bekker's"", 'The Invisible World', 'Agnes', 'Glanville', 'The Secret of Secrets']";['Agnes']
30359;Blood of Elves;She shed tears over the ballads of Essi Daven, subtle, infused with mystery, and collected in a small, beautifully bound volume entitled The Blue Pearl.;['Essi Daven', 'The Blue Pearl'];['Essi']
30363;Blood of Elves;In the beginning it had seemed that Yennefer was not at all interested in her lot, in her childhood in Cintra or the later events of war.;['Yennefer', 'Cintra'];['Yennefer']
30365;Blood of Elves;Ciri had to reply and did so very unwillingly because every question the magician asked opened a door in her memory which she had promised herself never to open, which she wanted to keep forever locked.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30366;Blood of Elves;Ever since she had met Geralt in Sodden, she had believed she had begun 'another life', that the other life - the one in Cintra - had been irrevocably wiped out.;['Geralt', 'Sodden', 'Cintra'];['Geralt']
30367;Blood of Elves;The witchers in Kaer Morhen never asked her about anything and, before coming to the temple, Geralt had even prevailed upon her not to say a word to anyone about who she was.;['Kaer Morhen', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
30368;Blood of Elves;Nenneke, who, of course knew about everything, saw to it that to the other priestesses and the novices Ciri was exceptionally ordinary, an illegitimate daughter of a knight and a peasant woman, a child for whom there had been no place either in her father's castle or her mother's cottage.;['Nenneke', 'Ciri'];['Nenneke', 'Ciri']
30370;Blood of Elves;And Yennefer too knew the secret.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30372;Blood of Elves;Yennefer asked.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30375;Blood of Elves;'How did you get out of the town, Ciri?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30377;Blood of Elves;Ciri did not remember.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30385;Blood of Elves;Yennefer did not insist.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30387;Blood of Elves;She did so gently and tactfully and Ciri grew more and more at ease.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30390;Blood of Elves;About how she learned about the Law of Surprise and that fate had decreed her to be the destiny of Geralt of Rivia, the white-haired witcher.;['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']
30392;Blood of Elves;How Geralt had found her there and taken her to Kaer Morhen, the Witchers' Keep, thus opening a new chapter in her short life.;['Geralt', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Geralt']
30394;Blood of Elves;'Oh!' said Yennefer on listening to the story, 'I'd give a lot to see that - Geralt, I mean.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30396;Blood of Elves;Because he must have had a wonderful expression when he found out who you were?' Ciri giggled and her emerald eyes lit up devilishly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30403;Blood of Elves;Yennefer burst out laughing.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30404;Blood of Elves;That laughter, thought Ciri watching swarms of black birds flying eastwards, that laughter, shared and sincere, really brought us together, her and me.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30407;Blood of Elves;Suddenly we became close, although I knew perfectly well that Geralt both brought us together and separated us, and that that's how it would always be.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

30440;Blood of Elves;Ciri was hungry and her saliva was thick from thirst, but she knew that complaining would not get her anywhere.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30441;Blood of Elves;"In the past, a month ago, Yennefer had reacted to such complaints with a dry lecture on how to control such primitive instincts; later, she had ignored them in contemptuous silence.";['a month ago', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30444;Blood of Elves;She's going to ask me something in a moment, thought Ciri, I can hear her thinking about it.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30451;Blood of Elves;'Tell me about your parents, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30475;Blood of Elves;Come here to me, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30477;Blood of Elves;'Where is Eist?' 'The King ...' stammered Crach.;"[""'The King"", 'Crach']";['Crach']
30486;Blood of Elves;Why did you allow it, Crach?';['Crach'];['Crach']
30498;Blood of Elves;Calanthe looked at Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

30526;Blood of Elves;A tempest which should not have broken out ... Ciri turned her head away so that Yennefer would not see the tears swelling in her eyes.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
30545;Blood of Elves;That means the dreams started after you met Geralt in Brokilon?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
30548;Blood of Elves;But Yennefer did not ask anything.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30594;Blood of Elves;Yennefer put her arm around Ciri, kissed her gently on the hair at her temple.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
30596;Blood of Elves;Vil-gefortz, Francesca, Terranova ...;['Vil-gefortz', 'Francesca', 'Terranova'];['Francesca']
30599;Blood of Elves;Don't worry, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30631;Blood of Elves;Yennefer and Nenneke did not talk to each other for a week.;['Yennefer', 'Nenneke', 'a week'];['Yennefer', 'Nenneke']
30632;Blood of Elves;For a week, Ciri lazed around, read books and got bored because the magician had put her studies on hold.;['a week', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
30634;Blood of Elves;After a week, Ciri had had enough.;['a week', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
30636;Blood of Elves;Yennefer was silent.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30641;Blood of Elves;And then, to Ciri's great joy, everything returned to normal.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30642;Blood of Elves;'Look into my eyes, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30644;Blood of Elves;The formula, please!' 'Aine verseos!';['Aine'];['Aine']
30675;Blood of Elves;It really is necessary, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30733;Blood of Elves;So, use your memory!' 'Aine verseos ...;['Aine'];['Aine']
30742;Blood of Elves;Yennefer persuaded Nenneke to take Ciri's sword out of storage and so enabled the girl to practise her steps, dodges and attacks - in secret, of course, to prevent the other priestesses and novices seeing her.;['Yennefer', 'Nenneke', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Nenneke', 'Ciri']
30744;Blood of Elves;Ciri learned how - using simple spells and focusing her will - to relax her muscles, combat cramps, control adrenalin, how to master her aural labyrinth and its nerve, how to slow or speed her pulse and how to cope without oxygen for short periods.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30747;Blood of Elves;She knew Vesemir and Eskel.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
30748;Blood of Elves;Although not Lambert and Coen.;['Lambert', 'Coen'];['Lambert']
30749;Blood of Elves;Yennefer used to visit Kaer Morhen.;['Yennefer', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Yennefer']
30750;Blood of Elves;Ciri guessed why - when they spoke of the Keep - the eyes of the enchantress grew warm, lost their angry gleam and their cold, indifferent, wise depth.;['Ciri', 'Keep'];['Ciri']
30751;Blood of Elves;If the words had befitted Yennefer's person, Ciri would have called her dreamy, lost in memories.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
30752;Blood of Elves;Ciri could guess the reason.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30756;Blood of Elves;Yennefer, as if casually, as if indifferently, asking as if banal, sparing questions, dragged the rest from her.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
30758;Blood of Elves;Ciri could guess the reason.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30816;Blood of Elves;Ciri, sparingly does not mean weakly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30853;Blood of Elves;Easy, Nenneke!;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
30858;Blood of Elves;On afternoons like this Yennefer carried Nenneke's wicker chair out into the garden and sat in it, stretching her legs out in front of her.;['afternoons', 'Yennefer', 'Nenneke'];['Yennefer', 'Nenneke']
30861;Blood of Elves;With one hand, and lost in thought, she ruffled her black, shiny locks, with the other she stroked Ciri's head as she sat on the grass, snuggled up to the magician's warm, firm thigh.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
30893;Blood of Elves;And how old were you ... when you met Geralt?' 'Older, ugly one.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

30999;Blood of Elves;Only Nenneke saw them off.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
31000;Blood of Elves;She spoke quietly and at length with Yennefer, then they both - the magician and the priestess -shook each other's hand, hard, like men.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
31001;Blood of Elves;Ciri, holding the reins of her dapple-grey mare, wanted to say goodbye in the same way, but Nenneke did not allow it.;['Ciri', 'Nenneke'];['Ciri', 'Nenneke']

31033;Times of Contempt;In order to make a living as a courier, Aplegatt used to say to the youngsters applying in the ranks, two things are needed - a head of gold and an ass of steel.;['Aplegatt', 'two'];['Aplegatt']
31034;Times of Contempt;A head of gold is indispensable, taught Aplegatt, since inside of the leather sack under his clothes the courier keeps only messages of low importance, the kind that can be fearlessly entrusted to the treacherous paper.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31044;Times of Contempt;But who needs couriers nowadays Master Aplegatt, asked the youngsters.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31053;Times of Contempt;Couriers are not needed anymore, Master Aplegatt.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31054;Times of Contempt;For some time Aplegatt also thought that he's not needed by anybody anymore.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']

31093;Times of Contempt;There were many wagons on this road and Aplegatt sighed with relief.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']

31221;Times of Contempt;asked Aplegatt 'a Dragon?';['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31242;Times of Contempt;Aplegatt raised his head.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31249;Times of Contempt;Aplegatt rode along.;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31261;Times of Contempt;'Ha!' murmured Aplegatt deep in thoughts 'I've been riding all over the world for so many years and yet I've never once seen a witcher.;['Aplegatt', 'so many years'];['Aplegatt']
31298;Times of Contempt;'Hmm...' murmured Aplegatt 'Which way did he go?;['Aplegatt'];['Aplegatt']
31313;Times of Contempt;And Ciri didn't seem to notice him, she kept galloping further in the night, between the old, twisted willows and alders which waved their limbs as if trying to catch her.;['Ciri', 'the night'];['Ciri']
31317;Times of Contempt;He could only watch how the winged knight rides up to Ciri, catches her by the hair, pulls her off the horse and drags behind him.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
31337;Times of Contempt;Geralt however knew far too well that the service provided by Codringher and Fenn had little to do with law and the partners themselves had many reasons to stay away from its representatives.;['Geralt', 'Codringher and Fenn'];['Geralt']
31341;Times of Contempt;Geralt knocked and backed away.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
31343;Times of Contempt;In theory, the spikes were shot only when someone tried to pick the locks or when Codringher or Fenn pressed the triggering device but Geralt often had the chance of finding out that there are no perfectly reliable mechanisms and every each one of them sometimes activates even when it ought not to.;['Codringher', 'Geralt', 'one'];['Codringher', 'Geralt']
31346;Times of Contempt;The door opened and Codringher stood at it.;['Codringher'];['Codringher']

31356;Times of Contempt;Codringher laughed loudly, confirming the witcher's suspicion that Fenn was an imaginary person, existing only to confuse the provosts, bailiffs, tax collectors and other unwelcome guests.;['Codringher', 'Fenn'];['Codringher']
31359;Times of Contempt;On the armchair across from him settled Codringher, the man who demanded to be titled an 'advocate' and a man for whom there were no impossible things.;['Codringher'];['Codringher']
31360;Times of Contempt;Whenever someone had any troubles, problems, hardships â€“ they went straight to Codringher.;['Codringher'];['Codringher']
31370;Times of Contempt;Then they saw 'advocate' Codringher, short, thin, with greyish hair and unhealthy skin of a person who doesn't get enough fresh air.;['Codringher'];['Codringher']

32766;Times of Contempt;'I have expenses, Molnar.;['Molnar'];['Molnar']
32767;Times of Contempt;And if I try to pay them from the account at Vivaldi's bank, someone might end up drowning again, so...' 'Yennefer,' the dwarf interrupted.;['Vivaldi', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
32775;Times of Contempt;Ciri pricked her ears up.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32786;Times of Contempt;The dwarf put down his pen, glanced at Ciri and gave her an understanding smile.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32787;Times of Contempt;Ciri, still pretending to be busy with the book, listened carefully.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32788;Times of Contempt;'Is that all, Yennefer?';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
32798;Times of Contempt;'You have already paid your interest,' the dwarf raised his head, 'for the whole Giancardi family, Yennefer, during the pogrom in Vengerberg.;['Giancardi', 'Yennefer', 'Vengerberg'];['Yennefer']

32812;Times of Contempt;The sorceress glanced briefly at Ciri, frowning deeply.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32813;Times of Contempt;'Molnar,' she said coldly.;['Molnar'];['Molnar']
32823;Times of Contempt;Yennefer's voice changed a bit.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
32826;Times of Contempt;If you truly wish to do something for me, Molnar, then get involved in this.;['Molnar'];['Molnar']
32832;Times of Contempt;Yennefer glared at Ciri, who was watching them and listening, not even pretending to be interested in the Physiologus.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
32835;Times of Contempt;Ciri lowered her gaze.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32840;Times of Contempt;Let's change the subject, Molnar.';['Molnar'];['Molnar']
32848;Times of Contempt;Let her out from under your wings for a while, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
32850;Times of Contempt;'Oh, yes!' cried out Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32852;Times of Contempt;Ciri wasn't sure, but suspected that it was influenced by a wink from the banker.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32860;Times of Contempt;'Forgive me, Molnar,' Yennefer didn't return the smile.;['Molnar', 'Yennefer'];['Molnar', 'Yennefer']
32874;Times of Contempt;'I promise, Mistress Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
32890;Times of Contempt;'Fabio Sachs,' Giancardi announced.;['Fabio Sachs', 'Giancardi'];['Fabio']
32892;Times of Contempt;'Fabio, this is Lady Yennefer, our honourable guest and client.;['Fabio', 'Lady Yennefer'];['Fabio']
32895;Times of Contempt;The boy bowed again, this time in the direction of Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32896;Times of Contempt;'Ciri,' said Yennefer coldly.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
32901;Times of Contempt;'Molnar,' sighed the sorceress.;['Molnar'];['Molnar']
32911;Times of Contempt;And when I, Fabio Sachs Junior, son of Fabio Sachs, swear to do something best I can then... then many a man cannot compete.';['Fabio Sachs Junior', 'Fabio Sachs'];['Fabio']
32912;Times of Contempt;Yennefer gazed at him for a while, then turned to the banker.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
32913;Times of Contempt;'Congratulations, Molnar,' she said.;['Molnar'];['Molnar']
32917;Times of Contempt;Ciri, I entrust you to the care of Fabio, son of Fabio, for it is a man of honour and can be relied on.';['Fabio', 'Fabio'];['Fabio', 'Fabio']
32919;Times of Contempt;Ciri realised that she had too.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32920;Times of Contempt;'Fabio,' the dwarf opened a casket, rummaging through its contents.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32925;Times of Contempt;'Noon, Ciri,' reminded Yennefer.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
32928;Times of Contempt;*** 'I'm Fabio,' said the boy, once they ran down the stairs onto a busy street.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32930;Times of Contempt;And your name is Ciri, right?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32931;Times of Contempt;'Yes.' 'What would you like to see in Gors Velen, Ciri?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32944;Times of Contempt;The disorder made Ciri a bit dizzy â€“ clumsily, she stepped down the wooden pavement and fell ankle-high into mud and manure.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32945;Times of Contempt;Fabio offered his hand but she rejected the help.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32962;Times of Contempt;'Your mistress,' said Fabio suddenly, 'seems very firm.';['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32967;Times of Contempt;How?' 'She's very beautiful,' answered Fabio with the cruel, disarming honesty of a youth.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32968;Times of Contempt;Ciri spun abruptly, but before she had a chance to retort with a biting remark alluding to his height and freckles, the boy was already dragging her between the trolleys, barrels and stalls, while explaining that the turret adjoining the square is called The Thief's Tower, that it was built of stones found at the bottom of the sea, and that the trees growing beneath it are called sycamores.;"['Ciri', 'turret', ""The Thief's Tower""]";['Ciri']
32969;Times of Contempt;'You sure are quiet, Ciri,' he noticed after a while.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
32980;Times of Contempt;Fabio had a hard time catching his breath, as he never stopped talking.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32981;Times of Contempt;"Ciri was informed that the wall surrounding Gors Velen was a fairly new construction, much younger than the town itself, which had been built by the elves; that it was thirty five feet tall and that this type of a construction was called a casemate wall, made of hewn stone and adobe brick, because this sort of material was best-suited to withstand blows from a battering ram.";['Ciri', 'Gors Velen', 'thirty \r\nfive feet', 'hewn'];['Ciri']
32985;Times of Contempt;'What is that, Fabio?;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
32993;Times of Contempt;'All of this was built by the elves,' explained Fabio.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33018;Times of Contempt;Fabio?' 'Yes?' 'How often do you see the students of this school?;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33027;Times of Contempt;'Just as I thought,' Ciri nodded, gazing at the shiny roofs of Aretuza.;['Ciri', 'Aretuza'];['Ciri']
33031;Times of Contempt;'Maybe a bit,' admitted Fabio.;"[""'Maybe"", 'Fabio']";['Fabio']
33041;Times of Contempt;Oh, Ciri, they're not locked up there by force.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33043;Times of Contempt;'Yeah, right,' Ciri grinned mischievously.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33050;Times of Contempt;Fabio?;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33066;Times of Contempt;'Fifteen miles', Ciri repeated after him.;['Fifteen miles', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
33068;Times of Contempt;Thank you, Fabio.';['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33073;Times of Contempt;Ciri had never before seen such a hustle and bustle like the one at the square in Gors Velen.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33076;Times of Contempt;Fabio, however, managed to get through the rabble, pulling Ciri behind him.;['Fabio', 'Ciri'];['Fabio', 'Ciri']
33083;Times of Contempt;Ciri dodged before a squealing swine and fell onto chicken cages.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33088;Times of Contempt;'Fabio?' 'A camel.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33098;Times of Contempt;'What is this wonderful smell?' 'Doughnuts,' Fabio groped the pouch.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33102;Times of Contempt;Ciri watched the breaking of the penny, hungrily devouring the first doughnut.;['Ciri', 'first'];['Ciri']
33104;Times of Contempt;'Indeed,' Fabio bit on his doughnut.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33111;Times of Contempt;Ciri was in high spirit and the bustling square ceased to terrify and began fascinating her instead.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33112;Times of Contempt;She no longer followed Fabio, now she was the one who drugged the other in the biggest crowd, to a place where someone spoke to the mob from a makeshift platform supported on barrels.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33114;Times of Contempt;Judging by his shaved head and grey robe Ciri assumed him to be an errant priest.;['grey', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
33124;Times of Contempt;'And then I'll have to put them bloody things back up again,' complained the journeyman mason in a lime-stained coat, who stood next to Ciri.;['the journeyman mason', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
33138;Times of Contempt;Fabio pulled Ciri's sleeve and they dove back into the crowd which was moving to the centre of the square.;['Fabio', 'Ciri'];['Fabio', 'Ciri']
33144;Times of Contempt;The same applies to Justin Ingvar, a blacksmith, born a dwarf, who had been forging arrows for those scoundrels.;['Justin Ingvar'];['Justin']
33151;Times of Contempt;The town crier continued reading announcements of the Count and town council, but Ciri lost interest.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33154;Times of Contempt;The narrow space made it almost impossible to turn, but Ciri had learned in Kaer Morhen how to move in places where it's difficult to do so.;['Ciri', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Ciri']
33159;Times of Contempt;The priest clearly never dealt with Yennefer's ward.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33161;Times of Contempt;Ciri hissed with fury.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33163;Times of Contempt;Taking advantage of the fact that priest couldn't move while trapped in the crowd, she tried to kick him, but Fabio prevented her, quickly drawing her away from the clergyman.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33164;Times of Contempt;Seeing her shake with anger he proceeded to calm her down with sugar-sprinkled funnel cake, the sight of which immediately turned Ciri's thought away from the incident.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33171;Times of Contempt;Fabio licked his fingers and pulled Ciri by the sleeve.;['Fabio', 'Ciri'];['Fabio', 'Ciri']
33177;Times of Contempt;Fabio spent the rest of his money on a basket of bergamot pears.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33178;Times of Contempt;Ciri looked up at the sun but decided that it wasn't yet noon.;['Ciri', 'noon'];['Ciri']
33179;Times of Contempt;'Fabio?;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33186;Times of Contempt;'Dark-skinned Leila,' Ciri deciphered the lopsided sign on the side.;['Leila', 'Ciri'];['Leila', 'Ciri']
33188;Times of Contempt;What kind of secrets...' 'Let's go, let's go,' urged Fabio, flushing pink.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33192;Times of Contempt;'Such a waste of money,' scoffed Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33198;Times of Contempt;Don't be petty, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33206;Times of Contempt;'Well...' stammered Fabio.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33211;Times of Contempt;He will, Ciri realized suddenly, feeling her head spin.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33214;Times of Contempt;Fabio Sachs, the great explorer...;['Fabio Sachs'];['Fabio']
33227;Times of Contempt;'I think it might be that sauerkraut,' said Fabio with seriousness.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33231;Times of Contempt;Ciri boldly raised her head, indeed feeling much better.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33239;Times of Contempt;Ciri had outplayed most boys from Skellige and all girls at the Melitele Temple.;['Ciri', 'Skellige', 'the Melitele Temple'];['Ciri']
33256;Times of Contempt;Two fivers for women with kids!';['Two'];['Two']
33257;Times of Contempt;'Ha!' exclaimed Ciri, brushing off the wasps buzzing around the pears, 'A basilisk?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33261;Times of Contempt;Let's go, Fabio.';['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33269;Times of Contempt;'He,' Ciri pointed her pear at Fabio, 'is a kid.;['Ciri', 'Fabio'];['Ciri', 'Fabio']
33290;Times of Contempt;Ciri and Fabio made their way to the front.;['Ciri', 'Fabio'];['Ciri', 'Fabio']
33297;Times of Contempt;The only one who didn't laugh was Ciri, staring at the creature which attacked the bars annoyed by the noise, trying in vain to unfurl its maimed wings.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33306;Times of Contempt;said Ciri, spitting out a seed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33313;Times of Contempt;'Let it go, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33314;Times of Contempt;Advised her Fabio, nudging her side.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33315;Times of Contempt;Ciri hissed at him, reaching for the next pear.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33321;Times of Contempt;Ciri sneered loudly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33355;Times of Contempt;Ciri pulled a face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33360;Times of Contempt;Ciri wrestled her arm from Fabio's grip and took a step forward.;['Ciri', 'Fabio'];['Ciri', 'Fabio']
33361;Times of Contempt;'I won't allow it!' cried the fair-haired squire, leaving behind his apricot companion and standing in Ciri's way.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33363;Times of Contempt;Ciri flushed at the title, gazed at the squire and fluttered her eyelashes at him in the way she had practiced on Jarre the scribe.;['Ciri', 'Jarre'];['Ciri', 'Jarre']
33365;Times of Contempt;She smiled seductively, forgetting Yennefer's warnings and her story about the idiot and the cheese.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33373;Times of Contempt;Ciri couldn't figure out why the expression of anger on apricot-lady's face filled her with so much delight.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33375;Times of Contempt;Fabio threw the squire a challenging glare.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33383;Times of Contempt;Fabio grunted loudly but Ciri didn't back off.;['Fabio', 'Ciri'];['Fabio', 'Ciri']
33398;Times of Contempt;"The squire caught Ciri's arm at the exact same moment she tried to leap away; as a result they both lost foothold and fell down, taking Fabio with them.";['Ciri', 'Fabio'];['Ciri', 'Fabio']
33402;Times of Contempt;Hissing and unfurling its maimed wings, the wyvern flew down from the podium and pounced at Ciri, Fabio and the squire, who were trying to pick themselves up from the ground.;['Ciri,', 'Fabio'];['Fabio']
33404;Times of Contempt;Ciri considered leaping away but realized that she wouldn't make it in time.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33409;Times of Contempt;The squire rose to his feet and reached to his side, but he didn't find his sword, because Ciri was quicker.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33412;Times of Contempt;It seemed to Ciri as if all the moves she had learned in Kaer Morhen had executed themselves without her will.;['Ciri', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Ciri']
33415;Times of Contempt;Ciri jumped over it, aptly dodging the tail, walloped the monster in the neck with precision, swerved, performed an unnecessary dodge out of a habit, and gave the opponent another blow, this time crushing its spine.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33417;Times of Contempt;Ciri quickly shoved the blood-stained steel into the squire's hand.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33425;Times of Contempt;'Ciri...' whispered Fabio kneeling beside her, 'What's wrong?;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33434;Times of Contempt;My beloved!' 'Fabio,' murmured Ciri, seeing town guards making their way through the crown.;['Fabio', 'Ciri'];['Fabio', 'Ciri']
33454;Times of Contempt;Ciri managed to get over her dizziness.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33455;Times of Contempt;'Fabio,' she whispered, 'We need to split up.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33460;Times of Contempt;She squeezed Yennefer's amulet and activated the spell.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33463;Times of Contempt;'The Hell?' moaned one, looking directly at the place Ciri stood.;"[""'The Hell"", 'Ciri']";['Ciri']
33468;Times of Contempt;Ciri turned around and walked away, still a bit dizzy from the rush of adrenaline and activation of the amulet.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33476;Times of Contempt;Ciri didn't have enough power to control it and prolong its work.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33477;Times of Contempt;Fortunately, the spell stopped working at the right moment â€“ just as she stepped out of the rabble and saw Fabio waiting for her.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33493;Times of Contempt;Please, Fabio, don't tell anybody about it.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33495;Times of Contempt;And definitely not lady Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33501;Times of Contempt;'It's not your fault,' disagreed Fabio.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33505;Times of Contempt;yelled Ciri, 'The squire did!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33513;Times of Contempt;she asked coldly, glaring at Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33514;Times of Contempt;'Wait, Tissaia,' said the other woman, younger, tall and blond, in a green dress with a considerable neckline.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
33524;Times of Contempt;Ciri frowned.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33532;Times of Contempt;Ciri clenched her teeth and her eyes shot green flames at them.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33534;Times of Contempt;The woman raised her hand and Ciri immediately understood the seriousness of her mistake.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33535;Times of Contempt;Yennefer had demonstrated to her paralysing spells only once, tired with her long whining.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33538;Times of Contempt;Fabio cried terrified and leaped towards her but the other woman, the blond one, caught him by the collar and forced him to stay in place.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33546;Times of Contempt;'No!' yelled Fabio.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33549;Times of Contempt;yelled Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33554;Times of Contempt;the blond woman urged Fabio.;['Fabio'];['Fabio']
33557;Times of Contempt;*** Margarita Laux-Antille emerged from the pool with a splash.. Ciri could not stop herself from taking a peek.;['Margarita Laux-Antille', 'Ciri'];['Margarita', 'Ciri']
33558;Times of Contempt;She saw Yennefer in the nude many times and she didn't think anyone could have a more beautiful figure.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33560;Times of Contempt;At the sight of a naked Margarita Laux-Antille even marble statues of goddesses and nymphs would sob with jealousy.;['Margarita Laux-Antille'];['Margarita']
33562;Times of Contempt;'Hey, girl,' she nodded at Ciri, 'be so good and pass me a towel.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33564;Times of Contempt;Ciri hissed quietly, still offended.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33565;Times of Contempt;When Fabio let out who Ciri was, the sorceresses dragged her through half of the city, exposing her to public mockery.;['Fabio', 'Ciri', 'half'];['Fabio', 'Ciri']
33567;Times of Contempt;The Sorceresses apologized to Yennefer, explaining their behaviour.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33570;Times of Contempt;Alarmed by the activation of Ciri's amulet, Margarita Laux-Antille and Tissaia de Vries mistook her for one.;['Ciri', 'Margarita Laux-Antille', 'Tissaia de Vries'];['Ciri', 'Margarita', 'Tissaia']
33571;Times of Contempt;The sorcerers' apologized to Yennefer, but none of them thought of apologizing to Ciri.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
33572;Times of Contempt;Yennefer was looking at her while listening to the apology, and Ciri felt like her ears were burning.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
33575;Times of Contempt;Yennefer, as it turned out, knew Tissaia and Margarita.;['Yennefer', 'Tissaia', 'Margarita'];['Yennefer', 'Tissaia', 'Margarita']
33576;Times of Contempt;The Sorceresses had invited them to the Silver Heron, the best and most expensive inn in Gors Velen where Tissaia had stayed upon arrival, avoiding, for reasons known only to her, approaching the island.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
33577;Times of Contempt;Margarita Laux-Antille, who was the Principal of Arethusa, had accepted the invitation of the older Sorceress and for a time shared a room with her.;['Margarita Laux-Antille', 'Principal of Arethusa'];['Margarita']
33579;Times of Contempt;They were in the basement baths, which Margarita and Tissaia had rented for their exclusive use, paying for it an unimaginable amount.;['Margarita', 'Tissaia'];['Margarita', 'Tissaia']
33580;Times of Contempt;Yennefer and Ciri of course, were encouraged to use the restrooms and as a result they had all soaked alternately in the pool and had spent a few hours sweating in the sauna, as well as non-stop chatting.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri', 'a few hours'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
33581;Times of Contempt;Ciri gave the towel to the Sorceress.;['Ciri', 'Sorceress'];['Ciri']
33583;Times of Contempt;Ciri snorted and jumped and splashed into the pool of scented rosemary water.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33584;Times of Contempt;'Floats like a little leaf', smiled Margarita as she lay down next to Yennefer on a wooden couch.;['Margarita', 'Yennefer'];['Margarita', 'Yennefer']
33592;Times of Contempt;'Good thinking', said Tissaia de Vries, who was busy ordering the drinks that, were on the marble table covered with a layer of vapour droplets.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
33593;Times of Contempt;'Good thinking, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33595;Times of Contempt;Ciri emerged from the pool and sat down on the edge of the timbering, twirling her hair and splashing her feet in the water.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33596;Times of Contempt;Yennefer and Margarita chatted idly, occasionally wiping their faces with cold, wet towels.;['Yennefer', 'Margarita'];['Yennefer', 'Margarita']
33597;Times of Contempt;Tissaia, modestly wrapped in a sheet, did not join the conversation, giving the feeling of being totally absorbed in bringing order to the table.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
33600;Times of Contempt;They say that this will suffer no delay!' Margarita Laux-Antille chuckled and winked at Yennefer, after which both, as to an order, withdrew the towels from their bosoms and adopted a position convoluted and highly challenging.;['Margarita Laux-Antille', 'Yennefer'];['Margarita', 'Yennefer']
33605;Times of Contempt;'Like children', sighed Tissaia de Vries, shaking her head 'Cover yourself, Ciri.';['Tissaia de Vries', 'Ciri'];['Tissaia', 'Ciri']
33610;Times of Contempt;'Madame,' said the woman dryly, making a slight bow towards Tissaia de Vries, resulting in a rattle of chain mail.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
33613;Times of Contempt;'Granted,' Tissaia said.;['Granted', 'Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
33616;Times of Contempt;Yennefer sat on the couch, and looked at the insignia on the shoulder of the warrior which had the colours black, yellow and red.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33626;Times of Contempt;'Very good,' laughed Margarita Laux-Antille.;['Margarita Laux-Antille'];['Margarita']
33631;Times of Contempt;'I noticed the hostility in your voice, Yenna' said Margarita finally.;['Yenna', 'Margarita'];['Margarita']
33634;Times of Contempt;Yennefer got up and took two cups from the table.;['Yennefer', 'two'];['Yennefer']

33664;Times of Contempt;Tissaia asked venomously.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
33665;Times of Contempt;'When I was Principal of Arethusa ...' 'I remember, we remember' Yennefer cut in with a smile.;['Principal', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
33667;Times of Contempt;Go for the carafe, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
33668;Times of Contempt;Above, while waiting for the carafe, Ciri witnessed the departure of the warrior and her unit, consisting of four soldiers.;['Ciri', 'four'];['Ciri']
33680;Times of Contempt;Before Ciri could take the carafe from the hands of the maid she watched as the postern gate was opened and Rayla and her unit went outside into the night.;['Ciri', 'the night'];['Ciri']
33682;Times of Contempt;'Well, finally,' Margarita said happily although whether it was from seeing Ciri or the carafe that she was carrying.;['Margarita', 'Ciri'];['Margarita', 'Ciri']
33683;Times of Contempt;Ciri put the carafe on the table, obviously wrong, because Tissaia de Vries immediately move it.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
33684;Times of Contempt;In serving, Yennefer destroyed the entire composition on the table and once again Tissaia started sorting it.;['Yennefer', 'Tissaia'];['Yennefer', 'Tissaia']
33685;Times of Contempt;Ciri imagined with horror Tissaia in the role of teacher.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
33686;Times of Contempt;Margarita and Yennefer resumed their conversation not forgetting the carafe.;['Margarita', 'Yennefer'];['Margarita', 'Yennefer']

34311;Times of Contempt;Yennefer laughed his fears off, but didn't insist.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34312;Times of Contempt;Since in all other situations she could be so insisting that the whole house shook and creaked, it only served to reinforce Geralt's belief that his suspicions were true.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
34317;Times of Contempt;After the talk at Hirundum's dike, Geralt would agree to every, virtually every offer from Yennefer.;['Hirundum', 'Geralt', 'Yennefer'];['Geralt', 'Yennefer']

34343;Times of Contempt;Upon taking a closer look, Geralt decided that there was more of the fancy than of the food.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
34345;Times of Contempt;He stated grimly, smartening up the short, black, snug-fitting jacket Yennefer picked for him.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34348;Times of Contempt;Yennefer didn't react.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

34381;Times of Contempt;Yennefer didn't drink at all.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34388;Times of Contempt;Geralt knew what to expect, therefore he quietly withstood the looks of insatiable curiosity from the sorceresses and enigmatic smiles of the wizards.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
34389;Times of Contempt;Despite Yennefer's insistence that the etiquette forbade the use of magic on such parties, he didn't believe that wizards could control themselves, especially with Yennefer provocatively bringing him out in the public's view.;['Yennefer', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer', 'Yennefer']
34394;Times of Contempt;He looked at Yennefer at his side, at the black-white, sparkling with jewels Yennefer, with her raven hair and violet eyes, and the eavesdropping magicians were losing focus and retracting abashed, to his utter satisfaction.;['Yennefer', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer', 'Yennefer']

34473;Times of Contempt;'I've always wanted to meet you, Geralt,' she smiled.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
34480;Times of Contempt;Yennefer replied casually, squinting her eyes a bit and ostensibly brushed her hair aside, revealing her earring a bit more.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34481;Times of Contempt;'Beautiful bodice, Sabrina.;['Sabrina'];['Sabrina']
34483;Times of Contempt;Am I right, Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
34485;Times of Contempt;Sabrina's bodice, weaved of black chiffon, revealed absolutely everything that could be revealed, and there was quite a bit of that.;['Sabrina'];['Sabrina']
34487;Times of Contempt;The trend, however, required the cut to reach the thigh, while Sabrina's reached the hip.;['Sabrina'];['Sabrina']
34489;Times of Contempt;'What news from Kaedwen?' asked Yennefer, pretending not to notice what Geralt was staring at.;['Kaedwen', 'Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']

34543;Times of Contempt;My deepest regards, mister Geralt...' Geralt, failing to ascertain that his regards were even deeper, shook hands with the man â€“ or at least tried to, because the size of the hand was well above the norm and made the handshake tough to execute.;['Geralt', 'Geralt'];['Geralt', 'Geralt']
34546;Times of Contempt;'I thought I saw you talking with Sabrina?' said Philippa.;['Sabrina', 'Philippa'];['Sabrina', 'Philippa']
34547;Times of Contempt;'I did talk with her,' hissed Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34554;Times of Contempt;Everyone knows that she's spying for Henselt of Kaedwen.';['Henselt', 'Kaedwen'];['Henselt']
34555;Times of Contempt;'Really?' Yennefer feigned ignorance, which was rightly accepted as a great joke.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34557;Times of Contempt;And how are you, count?' inquired Yennefer, once Philippa and Dijkstra finished laughing.;['Yennefer', 'Philippa'];['Yennefer', 'Philippa']

34584;Times of Contempt;They approached Triss, who was sparkling with shades of blue and aquamarine.;['Triss'];['Triss']
34585;Times of Contempt;Upon seeing them, Triss cut the talk with two male wizards, laughed brightly, hugged Yennefer and performed the ritual of air-kissing.;['two', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
34586;Times of Contempt;Geralt took the offered hand but decided to act against the customs â€“ he embraced the sorceress and kissed her soft, peachy cheek.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

44462;Baptism of Fire;Just behind him rushed Zoltan Chivay, seizing his sword wrapped in its skins on the cart.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']

44468;Baptism of Fire;Geralt had heard it, seen it and he knew what it was.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
44471;Baptism of Fire;Geralt jumped up quickly, grabbed her under the arm, interrupting her wild screech, and from the corner of his eye he spotted the movement between the logs.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
44472;Baptism of Fire;He retreated quickly, bumping into Zoltan and his dwarves.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
44473;Baptism of Fire;Milva, who also saw the movement among the stumps, stretched her bow.;['Milva'];['Milva']

44545;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan Chivay did not seem as if he intended on playing a round of cards, so the witcher found no problem in drawing him to a secluded place for a man to man chat.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
44551;Baptism of Fire;I could also say, that I am well travelled and have heard alot about Geralt of Rivia.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

44658;Baptism of Fire;Geralt whirled the sihill, it whistled as he passed it in a flash from his left hand to his right using two fingers.;['Geralt', 'two'];['Geralt']

44688;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan smiled proudly.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
44712;Baptism of Fire;Geralt listened with interest, shared his own experiences, and took the opportunity to enrich his knowledge asking about this and that, examining and testing Zoltan's sihill.;['Geralt', 'Zoltan'];['Geralt', 'Zoltan']
44714;Baptism of Fire;The first sign that people lived in the area, was a very regular stack of bark chips, which Percival Schuttenbach had spotted by the road while he was at the front of the group.;['first', 'Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']
44715;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan stopped the procession and sent the gnome to scout further.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']

44803;Baptism of Fire;Geralt and the others heard it, but they were not able to distinguish the words.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
44804;Baptism of Fire;Those words must have had an impression on Yazon and Caleb, because the two dwarves turned on their heels and ran back towards the lilac bushes.;['Yazon', 'Caleb', 'two'];['Yazon', 'Caleb']

45013;Baptism of Fire;He handed Zoltan his sword.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']

45081;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan cursed, shaking his head and helped move the cart around another of the holes.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45085;Baptism of Fire;Geralt explained that this was the fault of political geography.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45087;Baptism of Fire;In response, Zoltan obscenely described a place where they could remove the kings and their politics.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45090;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan's comparison to the donut and the jam turned out to be increasingly less relevant â€“ the road looked like a yeast cake, which had been laboriously gouged of all its raisins and almonds.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45094;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan rejoiced, because according to him the path led to one of the forts on the river Ina.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45099;Baptism of Fire;Since they could not be sure who was beating and burning and who was beaten and burned, they advanced cautiously, and sent Percival Schuttenbach ahead to investigate.;['Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']

45119;Baptism of Fire;Geralt - despite repeated threats â€“ decided to keep the chestnut and threw Zoltan Chivay into the saddle.;['Geralt', 'Zoltan Chivay'];['Geralt', 'Zoltan']

45210;Baptism of Fire;'Monsters?' Zoltan Chivay stopped and spat.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']

45258;Baptism of Fire;Face it Zoltan, we have been lucky as hell that nobody has discovered or pursued us.;['Face', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']

45570;Baptism of Fire;Percival was not mistaken.;['Percival'];['Percival']
45573;Baptism of Fire;He asked, lifting his black eyes under shaggy greying eyebrows to Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45584;Baptism of Fire;'Of course,' Zoltan Chivay grimaced slightly.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
45588;Baptism of Fire;'The smell gave you away, sir surgeon,' said Geralt, sliding his sword into its sheath.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45607;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan's beard bristled.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45627;Baptism of Fire;'You know about the war,' said Geralt, 'even though you live in a remote area, away from the world and its people.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45633;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan said interested.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45641;Baptism of Fire;'This gentleman here,' Zoltan pointed to Geralt, 'is a witcher.;['Zoltan', 'Geralt'];['Zoltan', 'Geralt']
45645;Baptism of Fire;'A witcher,' the surgeon looked at Geralt with undisguised curiosity.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45651;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan said, looking around.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45668;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan threw the medic a meaningful look.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45670;Baptism of Fire;*** 'Geralt,' murmured Zoltan as Emiel Regis disappeared behind a hanging curtain, which substituted as a door for his cabin.;['Geralt', 'Zoltan', 'Emiel Regis'];['Geralt', 'Zoltan']
45679;Baptism of Fire;'Experiments, Zoltan.;['Experiments', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45685;Baptism of Fire;Geralt shrugged.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45687;Baptism of Fire;'Hmm,' Zoltan thought.;['Hmm', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45696;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt, Percival, Dandelion, come see something interesting.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45703;Baptism of Fire;Upon seeing the stove, Percival Schuttenbach widened his eyes, opened his mouth and sigh with undisguised awe.;['Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']
45713;Baptism of Fire;He paused, seeing Zoltan place his thumb below the tube to catch a drop and then licked it.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45724;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan correctly him indignantly.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45727;Baptism of Fire;Try it, Percival.';['Percival'];['Percival']
45741;Baptism of Fire;'But dear, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45747;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan looked at the witcher, he understood the point, he turned serious and carefully backed away from the stove.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45757;Baptism of Fire;The witcher looked meaningfully at Zoltan.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45764;Baptism of Fire;'One is enough,' said Zoltan, taking the cup and carefully filling it.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45771;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan caught his breath.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45775;Baptism of Fire;Try it, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45778;Baptism of Fire;'Where are your manners, Dandelion?';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
45788;Baptism of Fire;Geralt took a sip, after a moment's hesitation he drank it to the bottom.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45791;Baptism of Fire;'I'll get Milva.';['Milva'];['Milva']
45797;Baptism of Fire;'This is the first time I've seen one,' said Dandelion, turning the branched root in his hands.;['first', 'Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
45800;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan said.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45804;Baptism of Fire;Milva bravely swallowed the moonshine, and burst into a coughing fit.;['Milva'];['Milva']
45823;Baptism of Fire;Milva commented.;['Milva'];['Milva']
45825;Baptism of Fire;'Bah!' Zoltan said, shaking his head.;['Bah', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45829;Baptism of Fire;'I think it is a story for the donkeys,' Milva took the cup, drank from it and shuddered.;['Milva'];['Milva']
45867;Baptism of Fire;'Of course not,' Zoltan said.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45869;Baptism of Fire;Give me the cup, Dandelion, because you're holding up the queue.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
45919;Baptism of Fire;The witcher raised the glass that Milva had filled and given to him, and drank to the bottom, then coughed until tears came to his eyes.;['Milva'];['Milva']
45927;Baptism of Fire;Geralt froze the poet with a look.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45938;Baptism of Fire;Geralt's lips turned up in an imitation of a smile.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45944;Baptism of Fire;'Or by a witcher,' snorted Dandelion, 'who has been reading, in order to impress a certain sorceress.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
45946;Baptism of Fire;Am I right, Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45948;Baptism of Fire;'Skip a few rounds, Dandelion,' interrupted the witcher coldly.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
45951;Baptism of Fire;'I might end up with those secrets of yours, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45952;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan frowned 'Dandelion has told us nothing new.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45956;Baptism of Fire;'Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
45965;Baptism of Fire;Geralt got up.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45970;Baptism of Fire;'You don't understand, Zoltan, I'm going to relieve myself.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
45976;Baptism of Fire;Geralt buttoned his pants.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
45977;Baptism of Fire;Milva, who had left the house shortly after, cleared her throat uncertainly.;['Milva'];['Milva']
45978;Baptism of Fire;Her shadow cast a shadow next to the one cast by Geralt.;['one', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
45986;Baptism of Fire;'Since we left Brokilon, twelve days have passed, during which we have travelled about sixty miles.Ciri, so the rumors say, is in Nilfgaard, the capital of the empire, a place that separates me by two thousand five hundred miles.;['Brokilon', 'twelve days', 'about sixty miles', 'Ciri', 'Nilfgaard', 'two thousand five hundred miles'];['Ciri']
46012;Baptism of Fire;'Milva?' 'What?';['Milva'];['Milva']
46019;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan greeted them cheerfully.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46022;Baptism of Fire;Geralt looked at the alchemist.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46024;Baptism of Fire;'Zoltan,' Regis lowered his eyes, 'made me realize that the war that sweeps around me is much more serious than the stories I have heard from the refugees.;['Zoltan', 'Regis'];['Zoltan']
46029;Baptism of Fire;'Two,' corrected the surgeon.;['Two'];['Two']
46032;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan belched loudly.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46042;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion, Zoltan and Percival were flushed, their voices had changed even more â€“ in the case of the poet and the gnome it came out a lisp.;['Zoltan', 'Percival'];['Zoltan', 'Percival']
46047;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan, who had become even more talkative than Dandelion, said he would not return under any circumstance to Mahakam, venting his displeasure of the order prevailing there, particularly in regards to the politics and the governor, Brouver Hogg who had absolute power over the dwarven clans.;['Zoltan', 'Mahakam', 'Brouver Hogg'];['Zoltan']
46058;Baptism of Fire;'Bullshit,' Zoltan drank from the cup.;['Bullshit', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46076;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan passed the gnome a full cup.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46110;Baptism of Fire;Percival wiped his nose with his sleeve.;['Percival'];['Percival']
46117;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan took another cup.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46130;Baptism of Fire;But we have other plans, right, Percival?;['Percival'];['Percival']
46134;Baptism of Fire;'Do not say a peep, Zoltan.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']

46144;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan, forgetting that he already told everyone about the old fart, Hogg the Mahakam thane, started again.;['Zoltan', 'Hogg the Mahakam'];['Zoltan']
46145;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, forgetting he had already been told or this, listened.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46150;Baptism of Fire;Milva commented.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46154;Baptism of Fire;Percival Schuttenbach muttered.;['Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']
46160;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan said.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46177;Baptism of Fire;'Do you hear that, Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46178;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan waved his arms in the air, almost knocking himself over on his back.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46180;Baptism of Fire;Beware, Percival, who you meet while asleep!;['Beware', 'Percival'];['Percival']
46183;Baptism of Fire;'And you, Geralt?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46184;Baptism of Fire;Have you dreamed of Ciri again?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46185;Baptism of Fire;Because you must know, Regis, that Geralt has prophetic dream!;['Regis', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
46186;Baptism of Fire;Ciri is a Child Surprise, Geralt is tied to her by ties of destiny, and therefore he sees her in his dreams.;['Ciri', 'Geralt'];['Ciri', 'Geralt']
46187;Baptism of Fire;Know that we are also headed to Nilfgaard to retrieve our Ciri, who has been kidnapped by the Emperor Emhyr.;['Nilfgaard', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
46193;Baptism of Fire;'I have not heard anything,' Zoltan said, looking boldly at the witcher.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46201;Baptism of Fire;'Indeed, artfully concealed,' nodded the surgeon, glancing at the pale with anger, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46209;Baptism of Fire;Pass the cup, Zoltan...';['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46231;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, can I pour you another?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46232;Baptism of Fire;Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46234;Baptism of Fire;Milva said.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46243;Baptism of Fire;Ciri, walking beside Mistle, saw the startled eyes of the girls and women, hard, unfriendly looks from the younger boys and men.;['Ciri', 'Mistle'];['Ciri', 'Mistle']
46245;Baptism of Fire;They whispered: 'Rats, Rats... Bandits...' 'Do not worry,' Giselher said aloud, and threw a money pouch to the silent musicians.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
46249;Baptism of Fire;Kayleigh shook his pouch.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
46255;Baptism of Fire;Finally one of the villagers ventured forth and went to Giselher with an earthen pitcher, with foam dripping over the edge.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
46256;Baptism of Fire;Giselher bowed and took a deep drink, and politely thanked them.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
46271;Baptism of Fire;'Falka!';['Falka'];['Falka']
46276;Baptism of Fire;Ciri, released herself from Mistle's arms, unwound the scarf from her neck and took off her beret and jacket.;['Ciri', 'Mistle'];['Ciri', 'Mistle']
46283;Baptism of Fire;Leaning to one side and throwing her head far back the elf tapped her feet, danced, beating her heels in a rhythmic and rapid staccato.Ciri, captivated by the rhythm, repeated the steps.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46284;Baptism of Fire;The elf laughed, jumped and changed the rhythm.Ciri with a violent jerk of her head, shook her hair off her forehead, she repeated the steps perfectly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46297;Baptism of Fire;The table was shaking, the light quivered, the audience wavered, everything was spinning, the whole barn danced, danced... villagers cried, Giselher screamed, Asse screaming, Mistle laughing and clapping, all clapping and stomping, the barn shaking, the earth shaking, the world shaking on its foundations.;['Giselher', 'Asse'];['Giselher', 'Asse']
46304;Baptism of Fire;Just a fiddle playing, flutes, bagpipes, drums raising and lowering the tempo, there is no need, there is just the rhythm, Spark and Ciri, their heels, the table swaying, rumbling and sways the whole barn...;['Spark', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
46311;Baptism of Fire;'I am Falka.;['Falka'];['Falka']
46312;Baptism of Fire;I was always Falka!;['Falka'];['Falka']
46316;Baptism of Fire;Spark and Ciri end their dance by stomping their heels, their elbows continuing to touch.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46319;Baptism of Fire;'Falka, you devil,' Spark gasped for breath.;['Falka', 'Spark'];['Falka']
46325;Baptism of Fire;Kayleigh violently pushed a villager, the villager pushed Kayleigh back, both struggled against each other, flailing with fists.;['Kayleigh', 'Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh', 'Kayleigh']
46330;Baptism of Fire;The elf took Ciri's hand and they both jumped down from the table onto the trampled ground.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46336;Baptism of Fire;The second, younger and slimmer, timidly bowed before Ciri.;['second', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
46338;Baptism of Fire;The boy grabbed Ciri around the waist.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46343;Baptism of Fire;Ciri danced.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
46362;Baptism of Fire;Geralt woke up in a corner of the cabin with his head in Milva's lap.;['Geralt', 'Milva'];['Geralt', 'Milva']
46363;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan and Dandelion lay in a pile of roots, snoring so loudly that the bundles of herbs on the wall swayed.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46364;Baptism of Fire;Percival was found behind the cabin, curled up next to a small tree covered with cherries, lying on a straw mat, Regis used to clean muddy boots.;['Percival', 'Regis'];['Percival']
46368;Baptism of Fire;Behind them stomped Zoltan Chivay, leading his chestnut stallion by the bridle.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
46371;Baptism of Fire;The least resistant to the effects of the mandrake proved to be Milva.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46374;Baptism of Fire;Geralt thought it best not to make conversation, the more so because he also was not in a good humour.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46377;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan almost stuck one with his stick, think they were a tombstone.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46390;Baptism of Fire;Instead of answering, one of the men pointed at Milva's horse.;['one', 'Milva'];['Milva']
46395;Baptism of Fire;'Huh?' Zoltan saw the looks and gestures.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46415;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan said with a smile.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46421;Baptism of Fire;Geralt asked, giving a stern look to his companions ordering them to be quiet.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46444;Baptism of Fire;'And the priests' Zoltan nodded seriously.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46458;Baptism of Fire;Milva, who during the entire conversation was staring impassively at the clouds, slowly looked down at the peasant, her features sharpened dangerously.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46462;Baptism of Fire;Milva wiped her sweaty neck and clenched her teeth.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46474;Baptism of Fire;'Then you are unlucky,' Milva said through clenched teeth, 'because I'm not giving up my horse.';['Milva'];['Milva']
46495;Baptism of Fire;Milva took a step forward and swiftly threw her right fist.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46505;Baptism of Fire;The peasants hurried to agree, they stared at Milva with their mouths hanging open.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46528;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan interjected quietly.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46534;Baptism of Fire;Geralt went to Milva and cleared his throat.;['Geralt', 'Milva'];['Geralt', 'Milva']
46543;Baptism of Fire;'We are using Pegasus and a chestnut.;['Pegasus'];['Pegasus']
46549;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan Chivay asked the witcher.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
46559;Baptism of Fire;What do you think, Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46570;Baptism of Fire;'Well done,' Geralt looked at him with unfeigned admiration.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46575;Baptism of Fire;'That's nice,' said Zoltan, waving his stick around.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46601;Baptism of Fire;'And even easier to see where it is not and never has been,' confirmed Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46611;Baptism of Fire;'Either way,' said Zoltan, 'the peasants are in luck.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46612;Baptism of Fire;I intend to wait at the camp for Munro Bruys and the boys.;['Munro Bruys'];['Munro']
46616;Baptism of Fire;And while we're at it,' Geralt pursed his lips, 'I'll ask you not to go around telling everyone who I am and my name.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46617;Baptism of Fire;This goes for you to, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
46622;Baptism of Fire;'And in earshot,' Milva said, breaking a long silence.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46631;Baptism of Fire;'May you be swept away with the devil for all your clever chatter,' Milva said angrily.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46633;Baptism of Fire;'Cabbage and shit always comes in pairs,' Percival Schuttenbach proclaimed a profound truth.;['Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']
46640;Baptism of Fire;Two of the women from Kernow who had been traveling with them had found in the camp their husband and his brother, who they had thought had died or disappeared without a trace during the maelstrom of war.;['Two', 'Kernow'];['Two']
46644;Baptism of Fire;'Inevitably,' Zoltan confirmed.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46654;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan looked at him sharply.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46666;Baptism of Fire;said Zoltan Chivay seriously.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
46675;Baptism of Fire;said Milva with a sad voice.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46677;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan repeated.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46693;Baptism of Fire;'Bah,' Zoltan said, planting on the bonnet of flowers he received from the girl.;['Bah', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46696;Baptism of Fire;Let us go, we can set up camp by the ford and wait for Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and the others.;['ford', 'Munro Bruys', 'Yazon Varda'];['Munro', 'Yazon']
46701;Baptism of Fire;'We must get fodder for the horses,' Milva said.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46709;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan and Milva began to get angry, but Geralt, not wanting any problems or the associated publicity, calmed them.;['Zoltan', 'Milva', 'Geralt'];['Zoltan', 'Milva', 'Geralt']
46711;Baptism of Fire;Percival Schuttenbach soon appeared, sullen and angry.;['Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']
46730;Baptism of Fire;Or from Zoltan and his parrot, he could receive a nasty stream of abuse, which, of course would do nothing.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46743;Baptism of Fire;'I predict a bad end for your race,' Zoltan said grimly.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46750;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion objected violently, and started to protest and bring forth cases of price gouging and utilitarianism by dwarves, but Zoltan and Percival drowned him out by imitating the sounds of a raspberry, which was considered by both races as a sign of contempt for the opponent's arguments in the dispute.;['Zoltan', 'Percival'];['Zoltan', 'Percival']
46758;Baptism of Fire;'I have nothing against it,' Zoltan said angrily.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46764;Baptism of Fire;'Well, that doesn't sound so bad after all,' Milva said, looking at the ground.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46774;Baptism of Fire;Milva screamed.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46781;Baptism of Fire;Milva's eyes narrowed ominously.;['Milva'];['Milva']
46785;Baptism of Fire;'Oh the bird has hit the nail on the head,' Zoltan drawled while patting the axe in his belt.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46790;Baptism of Fire;The dwarf gnashed his teeth and reached for his axe when Geralt grabbed him by the elbow.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46823;Baptism of Fire;Isn't that right, Percival?;['Percival'];['Percival']
46841;Baptism of Fire;They passed through the crowd although not without the help of Zoltan and his ash stick.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
46855;Baptism of Fire;Around his neck gleamed a sacred symbol, Geralt could not recognize what deity, and didn't know much about them anyway.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46870;Baptism of Fire;'Can we not find anyone,' growled Milva, 'who will stop this black fool?';['Milva'];['Milva']
46871;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion looked meaningfully and with hope towards the witcher but Geralt avoided his gaze.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
46888;Baptism of Fire;'And the money.' added Zoltan Chivay.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
46923;Baptism of Fire;I feel sorry for the girl, but this has gone a little too far...' 'Shut up,' Milva said.;['Shut', 'Milva'];['Milva']
46928;Baptism of Fire;'That is a bird bone,' said Zoltan Chivay serenely, rolling his eyes.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
46961;Baptism of Fire;Percival Schuttenbach blew his nose and wiped his fingers onto his leg.;['Percival Schuttenbach'];['Percival']
46966;Baptism of Fire;'Well, it has been shown,' rang the voice of Zoltan Chivay in the silence.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
46995;Baptism of Fire;'The judgement of God,' continued Geralt, in the absolute silence, 'is absolutely certain and fair.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47008;Baptism of Fire;'If you do not like the sword,' said Zoltan, coming to stand next to Geralt, 'and if this fellow does not fit you, maybe I will be worthy?;['Zoltan', 'Geralt'];['Zoltan', 'Geralt']
47010;Baptism of Fire;'Or me with the bow.' said Milva, squinting, also emerging from the crowd.;['Milva'];['Milva']
47026;Baptism of Fire;Milva looked at Zoltan, Zoltan the witcher, the witcher at the sky, and then at Milva.;['Milva', 'Zoltan', 'Zoltan', 'Milva'];['Milva', 'Zoltan', 'Zoltan', 'Milva']
47032;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan hissed through clenched teeth.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
47038;Baptism of Fire;The crowd gasped in unison, Zoltan cursed.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
47039;Baptism of Fire;Milva grasped Geralt's arm.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47070;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan shouted angrily.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
47084;Baptism of Fire;Milva yelled, sending kicks and punches around her.;['Milva'];['Milva']
47087;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47090;Baptism of Fire;The crowd parted, scattering like a wave in the surf, in the twinkling of an eye, it took Milva with it.;['Milva'];['Milva']
47091;Baptism of Fire;Geralt grabbed Dandelion by the collar but was not carried away because he managed to latch onto the wagon, which the girl accused of witchcraft was tied to.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47099;Baptism of Fire;Geralt raised his head, spat out the sand and saw a hilarious scene.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47102;Baptism of Fire;The two other people were Zoltan and Percival.;['two', 'Zoltan', 'Percival'];['Zoltan', 'Percival']
47105;Baptism of Fire;Geralt saw the mayor, gnome and dwarf go to congratulate each other for their success, when they fell straight into the next wave of the mob fleeing in panic.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47106;Baptism of Fire;Everything disappeared in clouds of dust, the witcher could see nothing more, He had no time to look anyway as he was busy saving Dandelion, who had been knocked over by a pig running blind.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
47107;Baptism of Fire;When Geralt bent to lift the poet, someone knocked a ladder onto his back from a passing wagon.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47112;Baptism of Fire;'Get up, Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47124;Baptism of Fire;Geralt sought to clear his eyes blinded by the flour and sand.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47135;Baptism of Fire;'I'm not sure,' Geralt gasped, 'if the horses have heard about this.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
47141;Baptism of Fire;Asse and Reef took up their swords, Iskra cursed loudly, because her head hit a rocky protrusion.;['Asse', 'Reef', 'Iskra'];['Asse', 'Reef', 'Iskra']
47143;Baptism of Fire;Kayleigh screamed.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
47147;Baptism of Fire;Giselher put a torch into the fire, lit it up, stood up and approached the place where Ciri and Mistle slept together, as usual, away from the rest of the gang.;['Giselher', 'Ciri'];['Giselher', 'Ciri']
47148;Baptism of Fire;Ciri sat with her head bowed, Mistle covered it.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
47149;Baptism of Fire;Giselher raised the torch.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
47151;Baptism of Fire;Mistle covered Ciri's bare shoulder with a fur.'Listen, Mistle,' the leader of the Rats said seriously, 'I have never interfered into what you two do in bed.;['Ciri', 'Rats', 'two'];['Ciri']
47160;Baptism of Fire;'Did you scream, Falka?';['Falka'];['Falka']
47161;Baptism of Fire;Ciri nodded.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
47165;Baptism of Fire;'Shut up, Mistle.Falka?';['Shut', 'Mistle', 'Falka'];['Mistle', 'Falka']
47166;Baptism of Fire;'A person, someone I knew,' Ciri stammered, 'a horse kicked him.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

48022;Baptism of Fire;Thank you, Fringilla.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
48025;Baptism of Fire;'First, it was Xarthisius who found the Cintran, it was he who brought her to Loc Grim.;['First', 'Xarthisius', 'Cintran', 'Loc Grim'];['Xarthisius']
48026;Baptism of Fire;The astrologer began to read horoscopes after he realized that he had brought a false princess to Emhyr and began an intensive search for the truth.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
48030;Baptism of Fire;Stefan Skellen, who was sent there, found nothing but scorpions and vultures.';['Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']
48031;Baptism of Fire;'I would not have expected anything else from Xarthisius.;['Xarthisius'];['Xarthisius']
48032;Baptism of Fire;But this will not have any influence on the issue of Cahir.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48033;Baptism of Fire;Emhyr is angry, but he does not send anyone to torture and death for no reason.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
48036;Baptism of Fire;So there is a conspiracy and Cahir has been drawn into it.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48040;Baptism of Fire;He would have been the one to bring the double to Emhyr.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
48041;Baptism of Fire;But Cahir has disappeared without a trace.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48044;Baptism of Fire;Could he have expected Emhyr would spot the fraud at first sight?;['Emhyr', 'first'];['Emhyr']
48046;Baptism of Fire;'A lock of hair,' interrupted Assire.;['Assire'];['Assire']
48048;Baptism of Fire;Fringilla, Emhyr has not been looking for this girl for three years, but much longer.;['Fringilla', 'Emhyr', 'three years'];['Fringilla', 'Emhyr']
48049;Baptism of Fire;It seems that Cahir has been pulled into something terrible, something that began when he was still riding around on a stick pretending it was a horse.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48052;Baptism of Fire;Fringilla shook her head slowly, her green eyes narrowing.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
48054;Baptism of Fire;But be cautious, Assire.Do not get into something terrible.;['Assire'];['Assire']
48058;Baptism of Fire;Assire var Anahid rose and went to the window, she stared out at the setting sun glistening on the roofs and towers of Nilfgaard, the capital of the Empire, called the City of Golden Towers.;['Assire var Anahid', 'Nilfgaard', 'the City of Golden Towers'];['Assire']
48063;Baptism of Fire;'I'm ready,' Fringilla answered the unspoken question of the Nilfgaardian sorceress.;['Fringilla', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Fringilla']
48067;Baptism of Fire;Assire var Anahid the Nilfgaardian sorceress turned around.;['Assire var Anahid', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Assire']
48072;Baptism of Fire;I'll give you the address of my seamstress, Fringilla.';['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
48077;Baptism of Fire;'If the imperials won, they would have taken everyone into slavery,' Cahir replied, also in a whisper.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48080;Baptism of Fire;Milva stepped on something and jumped back, stifling a cry at the sight of a hand emerging from the mud covered in leeches.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48081;Baptism of Fire;'It's just a corpse,' Cahir muttered grabbing her arm, 'Ours.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48101;Baptism of Fire;'You see well,' Milva let go of Cahir's arm, who had already reached for his sword.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48124;Baptism of Fire;'Do you know why Vissegerd didn't hang us right away?;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
48128;Baptism of Fire;Geralt heard him sniff regretfully.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48130;Baptism of Fire;'Vissegerd wants to carry out his private vendetta against me, but he has nothing against you.;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
48144;Baptism of Fire;He expected at any moment the woodshed would be invaded by Temerian military intelligence, who would certainly be working for Vissegerd.;['Temerian', 'Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
48146;Baptism of Fire;Geralt knew almost no details, but he knew that before the agents would believe him, he would become very, very sick.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48147;Baptism of Fire;His only hope was on Vissegerd, blinded by the desire for revenge, had not notified the agents of his capture.;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
48151;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48162;Baptism of Fire;From the camp they could hear cries, the stamping of horses and worse, the smell of the soldier's pea soup, a bowl of which at the moment Geralt would give all the steak and truffles in the world.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48165;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48167;Baptism of Fire;'I wonder what happened to Milva... And Zoltan, Percival and Regis...;['Milva', 'Zoltan', 'Percival', 'Regis'];['Milva', 'Zoltan', 'Percival']
48171;Baptism of Fire;'I don't believe that,' said Dandelion, stubbornly and with hope in his voice.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48172;Baptism of Fire;'I do not believe that people as sly as Zoltan, Percival... Or Milva...' 'Stop deluding yourself.;['Zoltan', 'Percival'];['Zoltan', 'Percival']
48192;Baptism of Fire;You go with the horses towards the brightest star of the Seven Goats.;['Seven'];['Seven']
48196;Baptism of Fire;'He is highly arrogant,' Cahir whispered to Milva after dismounting from their horses found them close to each other.;['Cahir', 'Milva'];['Cahir', 'Milva']
48199;Baptism of Fire;'I truly, do not know,' whispered Milva.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48203;Baptism of Fire;'No,' Regis said from behind Pegasus, giving evidence of exceptionally sensitive hearing.;['Regis', 'Pegasus'];['Pegasus']
48216;Baptism of Fire;Who is this man, Milva?';['Milva'];['Milva']
48219;Baptism of Fire;Ciri is not in Nilfgaard.';['Ciri', 'Nilfgaard'];['Ciri']
48223;Baptism of Fire;And what is your source, esteemed Cahir, son of Ceallach?';['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48226;Baptism of Fire;Geralt know that that there were three of them, so he listened, but the third soldier issued no sound.;['Geralt', 'three', 'third'];['Geralt']
48230;Baptism of Fire;He exhaled and cursed without a sound and was ready to immerse himself in thoughts of Yennefer when the witcher medallion around his neck quivered suddenly and a powerful smell struck his nostrils of wormwood, basil, coriander, save and anise.;['Yennefer', 'basil'];['Yennefer']
48237;Baptism of Fire;The medallion stopped vibrating, Geralt heard a sigh of relief from the poet and immediately after heard the sound of a knife cutting through rope.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48238;Baptism of Fire;A moment later, Dandelion groaned with pain caused by the circulation being restored to his limbs, he tried to supress the groans by biting his fist.;['A moment later', 'Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48239;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt,' The fuzzy, shaky shadow of the surgeon came near him and immediately cut the ropes.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48241;Baptism of Fire;Follow the brightest star of the Seven Goats to the east.;['Seven'];['Seven']
48243;Baptism of Fire;Milva is waiting there with horses.';['Milva'];['Milva']
48246;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion's circulation had had time to return to normal.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48275;Baptism of Fire;'Of course not,' Geralt, hidden in the darkness of the shed, looked around the square.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48293;Baptism of Fire;Geralt became restless, because he instinctively sensed danger and this feeling, as they moved further away from the center of the camp, grew instead of declining.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48296;Baptism of Fire;It was while leaving the camp that the witcher remembered that there was in Vissegerd's command the scourge of desertion and he was sure that the guards were ordered to give careful attention to any who wished to leave the camp.;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
48297;Baptism of Fire;The moon gave enough light so that Dandelion did not have to grope.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48305;Baptism of Fire;Geralt and Dandelion had barely approached the alder woods when dark silhouettes appeared in front of them.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48317;Baptism of Fire;Geralt had a chance to assess the situation.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48332;Baptism of Fire;Some were digging through leaves searching for the doubloons, others were dragging off Dandelion's other boot.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48333;Baptism of Fire;Now or never, thought Geralt, then punch the commander in the jaw as he fell he kicked him in the side of the head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48336;Baptism of Fire;Geralt ran after him.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48348;Baptism of Fire;Geralt cursed with rage when he heard cries, whistles and horses hooves.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48363;Baptism of Fire;But Geralt decided that he had had enough of the Cintra's lions and Temeria's lilies.;['Geralt', 'Cintra', 'Temeria'];['Geralt']
48369;Baptism of Fire;The swarm of Nilfgaardians approaching them was now a much greater threat that Vissegerd and his army, so they galloped along the ring of guard posts surrounding the camp, trying to get as far possible from the lines that could flare up at any moment when the two armies clashed.;['Nilfgaardians', 'Vissegerd', 'two'];['Vissegerd']
48371;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion yelled, Geralt looked back and saw as the dark wall of Nilfgaardians started to stretch out riders towards them like black tentacles.;['Geralt', 'Nilfgaardians'];['Geralt']
48375;Baptism of Fire;Vissegerd's army, stirred by the alarm, had mounted their horses in a time worthy of admiration.;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
48376;Baptism of Fire;Geralt and Dandelion found themselves trapped.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48380;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion yelled, this time in pain and dug his fingers into Geralt's ribs.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48392;Baptism of Fire;Geralt mercilessly forced the stallion to galloping further, because although it loomed before them they could still hear the rumble of hooves from behind.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48394;Baptism of Fire;Geralt unintentionally pulled on the reins, the horse reared up and they were both tossed to the ground landing in a bush.;['Geralt', 'bush'];['Geralt']
48405;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, without effort, sprang away from the blow, grabbed the saddle in one hand and with the other grabbed the wide belt of the Nilfgaardian.;['Geralt', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Geralt']
48412;Baptism of Fire;Geralt pushed down the arm with the white scorpion on the sleeve and raised the dagger to strike.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48424;Baptism of Fire;Geralt took off his jacket and tore off a sleeve.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48425;Baptism of Fire;The tip of the arrow had scratched Dandelion's ear, leaving a cut that reached to his temple.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48433;Baptism of Fire;Geralt quickly grabbed two of the Nilfgaardians horses, but they only needed one.;['Geralt', 'two', 'Nilfgaardians'];['Geralt']
48437;Baptism of Fire;They headed east, where in the brightening sky, shone the brightest star of the constellation of the Seven Goats.;['Seven'];['Seven']
48438;Baptism of Fire;*** 'Dawn will be here soon,' Milva said not looking at the sky but at the glossy surface of the river.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48441;Baptism of Fire;Shit, I hope that Regis knew what he was doing...' 'Do not lose hope,' Cahir murmured, as he rearranged the saddle on his recovered chestnut stallion.;['Shit', 'Regis', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
48442;Baptism of Fire;'Pah...I wonder...Come into contact with Ciri, is like putting your head under an axe...;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
48448;Baptism of Fire;'Here,' Cahir passed her a canteen.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48452;Baptism of Fire;'Who knows,' murmured Milva thoughtfully, pressing close to Cahir's arm, 'what will happen tomorrow?;['Milva', 'Cahir', 'tomorrow'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
48461;Baptism of Fire;'Tell me, Cahir, when did you meet Ciri?';['Cahir', 'Ciri'];['Cahir', 'Ciri']
48470;Baptism of Fire;'If Ciri is not in Nilfgaard,' she said after a long silence, 'then where?';['Ciri', 'Nilfgaard'];['Ciri']
48531;Baptism of Fire;'A little late,' said Vascoigne, the deputy commander of Drakenborg for political affairs, who was present at the executions.;['Vascoigne', 'Drakenborg'];['Vascoigne']
48536;Baptism of Fire;After less than an hour, Nazairian was sitting in a windowless dungeon and delighted at the beauty of life, a messenger was ready at hand and scratched his crotch with passion, while Vascoigne read and correct the report intended for Dijkstra.;['less than an hour', 'Nazairian', 'Vascoigne', 'Dijkstra'];['Vascoigne']
48537;Baptism of Fire;With humility I announce to Your Grace, a criminal by the name of Nazairian, condemned for the attack on a royal official, has confessed the following: Acting on the orders of a certain Rience, on the new moon of this year in July, along with two partners, the half-elf Schirru and the human Millet, took part in the murder of lawyers Codringher and Fenn in Dorian.;['Nazairian', 'Rience', 'July', 'two', 'half', 'Schirru', 'Millet', 'Codringher and Fenn'];['Rience', 'Millet']
48540;Baptism of Fire;What you may be interested in Your Grace is: before they committed the crime on the lawyers these villains, that is, Nazairian, the half-elf Schirru and the human Millet, were following a witcher, a man named Geralt of Rivia, who met with the lawyer Codringher in secret.;['Nazairian', 'half', 'Schirru', 'Millet', 'Geralt of Rivia', 'Codringher'];['Millet', 'Geralt', 'Codringher']
48541;Baptism of Fire;The subject of the meeting, the criminal Nazairian does not know, because before he could question them, they received an order from Rience to murder the two lawyers once he learned of the secret meeting with the witcher.;['Nazairian', 'Rience', 'two'];['Rience']
48542;Baptism of Fire;"Next the criminal Nazairian testified: His partner Schirru stole documentation from the house which he delivered to Rience at ""The Sly Fox"" inn in Carreras.";['Nazairian', 'Rience', 'The Sly Fox', 'Carreras'];['Rience']
48545;Baptism of Fire;And now follows the one thing I recommend you read with great attention Your Grace: The miscreants who snatched the girl and delivered to the Nilfgaardian commander of the fortress, assured him that the kidnapped girl's name was Cirilla of Cintra.;['one', 'Nilfgaardian', 'Cirilla', 'Cintra'];['Cirilla']
48550;Baptism of Fire;Yours Respectfully, etc, etc... Vascoigne sweepingly signed the report, then stamped it and called the messenger.;['Yours Respectfully', 'Vascoigne'];['Vascoigne']
48552;Baptism of Fire;Philippa Eilhart knew the next day at noon.;['Philippa Eilhart', 'the next day', 'noon'];['Philippa']
48553;Baptism of Fire;*** When the horse carrying the witcher and Dandelion emerged from the alders, Milva and Cahir were very nervous.;['Dandelion', 'Milva', 'Cahir'];['Dandelion', 'Milva', 'Cahir']
48558;Baptism of Fire;Milva was about to remove the blood soaked bandages when she felt a hand on her shoulder and smelled the familiar scent of wormwood, anise and other herbs.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48568;Baptism of Fire;Just then the witcher behaved in a way that Milva did not expect.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48577;Baptism of Fire;'Be brave, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48587;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, I'm at your disposal.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48589;Baptism of Fire;With a movement that was too fast for the eye to follow.'Step back,' Geralt growled at Milva.;['Geralt', 'Milva'];['Geralt', 'Milva']
48594;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt,' Dandelion moaned from the floor, fully conscious, 'Are you crazy?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48598;Baptism of Fire;Milva gently reminded him.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48602;Baptism of Fire;Milva suddenly saw with horror what she should have seen long ago.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48614;Baptism of Fire;'That's enough,' Geralt lowered his sword.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48651;Baptism of Fire;At the sight of them, Milva and Cahir drew back, and Dandelion stifled a scream of terror.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
48657;Baptism of Fire;'Now,' Geralt turned naked sword still in his hand, 'it's your turn, Nilfgaardian...';['Geralt', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Geralt']
48668;Baptism of Fire;But Cahir saved my life.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48675;Baptism of Fire;Roach as well?';['Roach'];['Roach']
48676;Baptism of Fire;'He saved them,' she nodded at Cahir.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48682;Baptism of Fire;Milva rode at the head, next to the witcher, all the while telling him in a low voice of her story of Cahir.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
48683;Baptism of Fire;"Geralt was silent as a mute; he never once looked back, never once laid eyes on the Nilfgaardian, whose was bringing up the rear, helping the troubadour.";['Geralt', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Geralt']
48690;Baptism of Fire;Milva was the first to see the boat among the reeds which must have been brought there by the current.;['Milva', 'first'];['Milva']
48699;Baptism of Fire;I am only interested in one thing: to get at the skins of those who have hurt Ciri.;['one', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
48701;Baptism of Fire;Cahir remained silent.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48702;Baptism of Fire;'Your revelation, which Milva told me about, does not change anything.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48703;Baptism of Fire;They only show one thing: At Thanedd you had not managed to kidnap Ciri, although you tried hard.;['Thanedd', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
48706;Baptism of Fire;Cahir remained silent.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48707;Baptism of Fire;Geralt felt bad.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48715;Baptism of Fire;'It may be,' Cahir said quietly, 'that against all appearances, we have something in common, you and me?;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48716;Baptism of Fire;'I wonder what' 'Like you, I want to save Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
48724;Baptism of Fire;Ciri dances in a shed on a table and is happy...';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
48725;Baptism of Fire;'Milva told you my dreams.';['Milva'];['Milva']
48729;Baptism of Fire;Cahir bowed his head and a scuffed his heel in the sand.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48735;Baptism of Fire;*** You could say that Servadio was simply lucky.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48741;Baptism of Fire;So the spies and informers like Servadio always had the possibility of obtaining some information in Loredo that was worth a few florens from the Prefect.;['Servadio', 'Loredo', 'Prefect'];['Servadio']
48742;Baptism of Fire;Now Servadio was counting on more than a few.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48744;Baptism of Fire;Giselher led, flanked by Spark and Kayleigh.;['Giselher', 'Spark', 'Kayleigh'];['Giselher', 'Kayleigh']
48745;Baptism of Fire;Behind them rose Mistle and this new girl, called Falka, Reef and Asse closed the procession, leading spare horses, likely stolen and had to be sold here.;['Mistle', 'Falka', 'Reef and Asse'];['Mistle', 'Falka']
48748;Baptism of Fire;All but Mistle and the new gray-haired girl, wearing a sword strapped across her back.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
48752;Baptism of Fire;Servadio carefully followed the girls.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48756;Baptism of Fire;Almost the whole time, Mistle held the hand of the gray-haired girl.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
48762;Baptism of Fire;Mistle bought two stick wrapped in snowy sweetness and gave one to the gray-haired girl.;['Mistle', 'two'];['Mistle']
48765;Baptism of Fire;Mistle wiped them off with gentle movements and careful treatment.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
48767;Baptism of Fire;Servadio felt a chill, a cold stream of sweat ran down his neck between his shoulder blades.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48770;Baptism of Fire;The girls were not talking about anything important, while not far away, where the elders of the gang gathered, Giselher, Kayleigh and the others argued noisily, bargained, shouted, again and again putting their cups under the tap of the keg.;['Giselher', 'Kayleigh'];['Giselher', 'Kayleigh']
48771;Baptism of Fire;With them, Servadio was more likely to learn something important.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48774;Baptism of Fire;And if on the basis of the information the Prefect managed to organise a successful ambush, Servadio could count on a substantial influx of cash.;['Prefect', 'Servadio'];['Servadio']
48778;Baptism of Fire;Servadio suddenly realized that they were being watched.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48780;Baptism of Fire;He knew that the pointing fingers belonged to thieves and cattle rustlers of the Pinto gang.;['Pinto'];['Pinto']
48782;Baptism of Fire;Mistle narrowed her eyes and put her hand on shoulder of the gray-haired girl.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
48785;Baptism of Fire;Servadio saw the gray-haired one trembling and saw Mistle tighten her fingers on her shoulder.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48787;Baptism of Fire;"Mistle turned slowly; some of them stopped laughing immediately.";['Mistle'];['Mistle']
48798;Baptism of Fire;The second thief bent down and drew a knife from his boot, but at the same time was felled by Giselher with the blunt shaft of a lance.;['second', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
48802;Baptism of Fire;Back off, Falka!';['Falka'];['Falka']
48804;Baptism of Fire;Giselher raised a purse and shook it.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
48809;Baptism of Fire;Hey, Pinto, what do you say?';['Pinto'];['Pinto']
48810;Baptism of Fire;Spark, Kayleigh, Asse and Reef stood behind their leader.;['Spark', 'Kayleigh', 'Asse', 'Reef'];['Kayleigh', 'Asse', 'Reef']
48812;Baptism of Fire;'Honestly,' said one of the bandits of the Pinto, a short man with bowed legs wearing a leather jacket.;['one', 'Pinto'];['Pinto']
48813;Baptism of Fire;'You speak truly, Giselher.End of row.';['Giselher'];['Giselher']
48814;Baptism of Fire;Servadio swallowed hard, trying to melt into the crowd surrounding the incident.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48815;Baptism of Fire;Suddenly he felt no desire to walk around near the Rats or near the girl with the ash coloured hair, called Falka.;['Rats', 'Falka'];['Falka']
48817;Baptism of Fire;Falka quietly slid the sword into its sheath while looking around.;['Falka'];['Falka']
48818;Baptism of Fire;Servadio was amazed when he saw her tiny face suddenly change.;['Servadio'];['Servadio']
48826;Baptism of Fire;Cahir, after the talk, disappeared into the bushes and did not come back.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48832;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion and Milva pulled the wicker trap from the water and started to curse, because instead of carp, they had caught little fish among the weeds.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48844;Baptism of Fire;Milva will lead you through the woods...;['Milva'];['Milva']
48847;Baptism of Fire;Milva brushed her hair from her shoulders.;['Milva'];['Milva']
48860;Baptism of Fire;'Listen,' said Geralt, much calmer now.;['Geralt', 'calmer'];['Geralt']
48870;Baptism of Fire;'Yes,' Geralt said angrily.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48880;Baptism of Fire;Geralt turned his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48889;Baptism of Fire;'I heard you conversation just now with Dandelion and the archer.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
48925;Baptism of Fire;The vampire left and joined Dandelion and Milva.;['Dandelion', 'Milva'];['Dandelion', 'Milva']
48947;Baptism of Fire;You clean the fish, Milva.';['Milva'];['Milva']
48962;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, help her.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48966;Baptism of Fire;Geralt turned his head, pretending not to hear.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48971;Baptism of Fire;Cahir appeared from among the reeds, holding a three pound pike still waving its tail and its gills opening and closing.;['Cahir', 'three pound'];['Cahir']
48976;Baptism of Fire;I come from Vicovaro and my name is Cahir...';['Vicovaro', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
48991;Baptism of Fire;Damn it, Geralt, how long are you going to sit there pretending to be offended?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
48993;Baptism of Fire;The Witcher got up obediently and moved closer, but sat conspicuously far from Cahir.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
48998;Baptism of Fire;The vampire stirred it with a spoon that Milva had carved from wood.;['Milva'];['Milva']
49002;Baptism of Fire;'Unless you use your socks,' Milva raised her eyebrows, while carving another spoon, 'we don't have a strainer.';['Milva'];['Milva']
49003;Baptism of Fire;'My dear, Milva,' Regis smiled.;['Milva', 'Regis'];['Milva']
49008;Baptism of Fire;'We can strain it threw my chainmail,' Cahir said.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
49010;Baptism of Fire;'Make sure you wash it first,' Milva said.;['first', 'Milva'];['Milva']
49013;Baptism of Fire;'Now throw away the slops, Cahir,' Dandelion ordered.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
49015;Baptism of Fire;There is no need for more wood, Geralt!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
49023;Baptism of Fire;Geralt stood up and turned his back.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
49026;Baptism of Fire;'Listen to him,' Milva said, her lip curling, 'he's such a charlatan.;['Milva'];['Milva']

49045;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, are you waiting for a special invitation?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
49049;Baptism of Fire;'I say,' gasped Milva.;['Milva'];['Milva']
49050;Baptism of Fire;'That it was a silly thing to have soup, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
49052;Baptism of Fire;'What do you say, Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']

49864;Baptism of Fire;The silence that ensued at the table following the speech by Philippa Eilhart was shortly replaced by a cacophony.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']

49867;Baptism of Fire;Fringilla Vigo knew nothing about the suspicions and speculations, and concentrated mainly on a certain lock of hair.;['Fringilla Vigo'];['Fringilla']

49869;Baptism of Fire;Philippa Eilhart took the floor again.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
49872;Baptism of Fire;I speak mostly of you, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
49874;Baptism of Fire;When Yennefer told the audience about Ciri, Triss Merigold closely watched her friend.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri', 'Merigold'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']

49877;Baptism of Fire;It was without a doubt that Yennefer was in this kind of situation.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

49881;Baptism of Fire;Assire var Anahid, had changed much, looking very carefully but it was obvious she still felt insecure about her makeup and fashionable dress.;['Assire var Anahid'];['Assire']

49883;Baptism of Fire;Both Nilfgaardians did not seemed lost among the intricacies of the history of Ciri, although Yennefer's story was long and rather confusing, beginning with the famous love affair in Cintra of Pavetta and the young man enchanted to be a hedgehog.;['Nilfgaardians', 'Ciri', 'Yennefer', 'Cintra of Pavetta'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
49884;Baptism of Fire;She spoke about the role of Geralt and the Law of Surprise and the binding of Ciri to the witcher.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
49885;Baptism of Fire;Yennefer spoke about Geralt meeting Ciri in Brokilon, about the war, about her disappearance and discovery, of her training in Kaer Morhen.;['Yennefer', 'Geralt', 'Brokilon', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']

49894;Baptism of Fire;Yennefer will speak in a moment about her arrival at Thanedd with Ciri, about what was said in the prophetic trance, which caused such a fuss.;['Yennefer', 'Thanedd', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']

49896;Baptism of Fire;Then the pretending will come to an end, thought Triss, the mask will drop.;['Triss'];['Triss']
49900;Baptism of Fire;How Yennefer disappeared from Thanedd, why she has suddenly appeared her in Montecalvo, along with Francesca.;['Yennefer', 'Thanedd', 'Montecalvo', 'Francesca'];['Yennefer', 'Francesca']
49901;Baptism of Fire;And who is and what role does Ida Emean, Aen Saevherne from the Blue Mountains play.;['Ida Emean', 'Aen Saevherne', 'the Blue Mountains'];['Aen']
49902;Baptism of Fire;Why do I have the feeling that Philippa Eilhart is saying less than she knows, but declares her devotion and loyalty to magic, and not Dijkstra, who she constantly exchanges correspondence.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
49903;Baptism of Fire;And maybe I'll finally learn who Ciri really is.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
49904;Baptism of Fire;Cirilla, Queen of the North to them, but to me an ash-haired little girl from Kaer Morhen, who I remember as a younger sister.;['Cirilla', 'North', 'Kaer Morhen'];['Cirilla']
49905;Baptism of Fire;*** Fringilla Vigo had heard a bit about witcher, professional individuals who were accustomed to killing monsters and beasts.;['Fringilla Vigo'];['Fringilla']
49906;Baptism of Fire;She attentively listened to Yennefer's story, listened to the sound of her voice, watching her face.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
49908;Baptism of Fire;A strong emotional bond between Yennefer and Ciri was evident.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
49910;Baptism of Fire;Fringilla began to reflect, but raised voices disturbed her thoughts.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
49911;Baptism of Fire;"She had already guessed that some of those collected here were in opposite camps during the Thanedd rebellion; she was not surprised, therefore, when the antipathies came to the table in the form of remarks aimed at Yennefer.";['Thanedd', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
49912;Baptism of Fire;It looked as if a quarrel was to break out, which was prevented by Philippa Eilhart who unceremoniously banged her open palm onto the top of the table until the cups and goblets rang.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
49915;Baptism of Fire;'Shut up, Sabrina!;['Shut', 'Sabrina'];['Sabrina']

49933;Baptism of Fire;Sabrina Glevissig snorted, but Philippa silenced her with a sudden gesture.;['Sabrina Glevissig', 'Philippa'];['Sabrina', 'Philippa']
49934;Baptism of Fire;'I did not want to interfere in what was happening in Aretuza,' said Yennefer, pale and clearly upset.;['Aretuza', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

49971;Baptism of Fire;We all know the legend of Lara Dorren and Cregennan of Lod.';['Lara Dorren', 'Cregennan of Lod'];['Lara', 'Cregennan']
49974;Baptism of Fire;'It is not a legend,' said Philippa Eilhart.;['Philippa Eilhart'];['Philippa']
49976;Baptism of Fire;Also among us is someone who knows not only the story of Lara and Cregennan, but also its consequences and these would also be very interesting for us all.;['Lara', 'Cregennan'];['Lara', 'Cregennan']
49977;Baptism of Fire;We ask you to speak, Francesca.';['Francesca'];['Francesca']
49984;Baptism of Fire;*** 'The story of Lara and Cregennan is a true story but so overgrown with fabulous ornaments it is hardly recognizable.;['Lara', 'Cregennan'];['Lara', 'Cregennan']
49987;Baptism of Fire;And yes, Cregennan of Lod was a sorcerer.;['Cregennan of Lod'];['Cregennan']
49988;Baptism of Fire;Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal was an elven sorceress, Aen Saevherne, one of the Knowing mysterious even to us elves, they carried Hen Ichaer, the Elder Blood.;['Lara Dorren', 'Aen Saevherne', 'one', 'Knowing', 'Hen Ichaer', 'the Elder Blood'];['Lara', 'Aen']

49993;Baptism of Fire;Lara Dorren, hunted and prosecuted, died of exhaustion in the wilderness, while birthing a daughter.;['Lara Dorren'];['Lara']

50003;Baptism of Fire;'In the past they did,' said Francesca.;['Francesca'];['Francesca']
50004;Baptism of Fire;'The rumours of Lara's curse were not silenced and were even remembered seventeen years later, when the girl who Cerro had sheltered, called Riannon, grew into a girl whose beauty overshadowed even the legendary beauty of her mother.;['Lara', 'seventeen years later', 'Cerro', 'Riannon'];['Lara', 'Cerro', 'Riannon']
50005;Baptism of Fire;The adopted Riannon bore the official title of Redania's princess and many ruling families were interested in her.;['Riannon', 'Redania'];['Riannon']
50006;Baptism of Fire;When among the many competitors Riannon finally choose Goidemar, the young king of Temeria, the marriage was almost destroyed by gossip about a curse.;['Riannon', 'Goidemar', 'Temeria'];['Riannon', 'Goidemar']

50013;Baptism of Fire;Falka was the daughter of Vridank king of Redania.;['Falka', 'Vridank', 'Redania'];['Falka', 'Vridank']
50014;Baptism of Fire;His first marriage fell apart, when his eye caught the beautiful Cerro, the same who later took in Lara's baby.;['first', 'Cerro', 'Lara'];['Cerro', 'Lara']
50015;Baptism of Fire;There are preserved documents that describe the lengthy and intricate grounds for divorce, but it also contains a telling portrait of Vridank's first wife, a noble of Kovir undoubtedly a half-elf, but with a strong dominance of human characteristics.;['Vridank', 'first', 'Kovir', 'half'];['Vridank']
50017;Baptism of Fire;In short: Ugly, her sent her back to Kovir with a daughter, Falka.;['Kovir', 'Falka'];['Falka']

50023;Baptism of Fire;Falka passed into legend as a bloodthirsty demon, although it is likely that she simply was unable to control the situation and still new slogans where printed onto the insurgents banners.;['Falka'];['Falka']

50036;Baptism of Fire;Riannon had gone mad.;['Riannon'];['Riannon']
50037;Baptism of Fire;Goidemar, full of rage, subjected the other prisoners to torture and from the snippets of testimony hear through their howls, he arranged a clear picture of the events.';['Goidemar'];['Goidemar']
50038;Baptism of Fire;'Falka, who took after the beauty of her elven grandmother rather than her mother, generously bestowed her charms to all the nobles, knights, captains and sergeants, ensuring their loyalty and fidelity.;['Falka'];['Falka']
50039;Baptism of Fire;Finally she became pregnant and gave birth to a child, just at the same time that Riannon, imprisoned in Houtborg, gave birth to twins.;['Riannon', 'Houtborg'];['Riannon', 'Houtborg']
50040;Baptism of Fire;Falka ordered to give her baby to Riannon.;['Falka', 'Riannon'];['Falka', 'Riannon']

50042;Baptism of Fire;'The problem was nobody, including Riannon, knew which of the three children, was Falka's.;['Riannon', 'three', 'Falka'];['Riannon', 'Falka']
50043;Baptism of Fire;It was alleged with a high degree of probability that it was one of the girls, apparently because Riannon gave birth to a boy and a girl.;['Riannon'];['Riannon']
50044;Baptism of Fire;Again, supposedly, despite the boastful declaration of Falka's her child was being nursed by an ordinary peasant wet nurse.;['Falka'];['Falka']
50045;Baptism of Fire;Riannon when finally cured of her madness remembered almost nothing.;['Riannon'];['Riannon']
50050;Baptism of Fire;Goidemar was so furious that once they had discovered Falka's bastard he had intentions of killing it publicly.;['Goidemar', 'Falka'];['Goidemar', 'Falka']
50055;Baptism of Fire;It was already beginning to circulate, a rumour that Falka was born as a result of the curse of Lara Dorren, which was of course, nonsense: Falka was born before Lara had ever meet Cregennan.;['Falka', 'Lara Dorren', 'Falka', 'Lara', 'Cregennan'];['Falka', 'Lara', 'Falka', 'Lara', 'Cregennan']

50075;Baptism of Fire;Goidemar, deep down, had a good and noble heart, he calmed down quickly and didn't urge us and soon the triplets had grown and ran about the palace, giving rise to joy to the royal couple and the whole court.;['Goidemar'];['Goidemar']
50076;Baptism of Fire;Amavet, Fiona and Adela were alike as three sparrows.;['Amavet, Fiona', 'Adela', 'three'];['Adela']

51329;Baptism of Fire;Geralt calmed down a bit â€“ in sight nothing moved and between the logs was not enough space to be able to hide a large group.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51349;Baptism of Fire;Hey, Yazon, you have sunk like a duck's ass!';['Yazon'];['Yazon']
51352;Baptism of Fire;The Witcher might have still remained cautious, after all Screwed could be played by many different people and many different people have the name Yazon.;['Yazon'];['Yazon']
51355;Baptism of Fire;'Greetings, boys,' Geralt said as he came out from behind a pile of logs.;['Greetings', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
51359;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan Chivay dropped his cards in surprise, after which he jumped to his feet so suddenly that Field Marshal Duda, who was on his shoulder, flapped his wings and shrieked with terror.;['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
51363;Baptism of Fire;Percival Schuttenbach, Munro Bruys, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo surrounded Geralt and patted and hugged him.;['Percival Schuttenbach', 'Munro Bruys', 'Yazon Varda', 'Figgis Merluzzo', 'Geralt'];['Percival', 'Munro', 'Yazon', 'Figgis', 'Geralt']
51367;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan shouted, squeezing all.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51373;Baptism of Fire;'And where is Caleb Stratton?';['Caleb Stratton'];['Caleb']
51375;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan and the other fell silent and suddenly became serious.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51376;Baptism of Fire;'Caleb,' the dwarf said at last, inhaling through his nose, 'lies under the ground next to a birch tree, away from his beloved mountain peaks and coal.;['Caleb'];['Caleb']
51383;Baptism of Fire;Cahir bowed slightly under the watchful gaze of the dwarf and said nothing.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51384;Baptism of Fire;'Well, sit down,' invited Zoltan.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51388;Baptism of Fire;And you, Regis, please come to this side for a moment and you to Geralt.';['Regis', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
51399;Baptism of Fire;Geralt came over to hold her, but the vampire restrained him with a gesture.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51403;Baptism of Fire;Geralt turned his head and looked at the two women with the two children and then at the dwarf.;['Geralt', 'two', 'two'];['Geralt']
51404;Baptism of Fire;Zoltan grunted.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51408;Baptism of Fire;'It just came out,' Geralt repeated, smiling slightly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51409;Baptism of Fire;'You are an incorrigible altruist, Zoltan Chivay.';['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
51414;Baptism of Fire;'By this Nilfgaardian who used to follow you, but is now part of your company?' 'Partially.Zoltan, where are the refugees?;['Nilfgaardian', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51430;Baptism of Fire;'I have no idea,' Zoltan scratched his ear.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51441;Baptism of Fire;Geralt was silent.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51444;Baptism of Fire;'To be able to perceive the disease in the blood, the essence of the disease but not be able to cure...' 'True,' sighed Zoltan, 'dressing the skin is one thing, but if the brain is fucked up, you cannot do anything.;['Zoltan', 'one'];['Zoltan']
51449;Baptism of Fire;'Hmmm,' Zoltan stroked his beard.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51450;Baptism of Fire;'So then, what are your plans to find Ciri?';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
51459;Baptism of Fire;Regis firmly grabbed the stunned Zoltan by the arm, and with a gesture ordered him to silence.;['Regis', 'Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51460;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, who knew about hypnotic trances, was silent and did not move.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51479;Baptism of Fire;*** Zoltan, Geralt remembered, still running his fingers over the blade covered in runes, after this event acquired a new respect for Regis, he abandoned the familiar tone with which he used to address the surgeon.;['Zoltan', 'Geralt', 'Regis'];['Zoltan', 'Geralt']
51483;Baptism of Fire;Admittedly, in this case it was not hypnosis, but the vampire's spell, and Geralt wondered what the girl would have drawn out of Regis's mind had the trance lasted longer.;['Geralt', 'Regis'];['Geralt']
51486;Baptism of Fire;'We have already made our decision, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51498;Baptism of Fire;'Wise,' Zoltan said as he removed from his back Sihil in its sheath, wrapped in goatskin.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51501;Baptism of Fire;'Zoltan...' 'Don't talk, just take it.;['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51505;Baptism of Fire;And when you find the ones who wronged your Ciri, give them one for Caleb Stratton.;['Ciri', 'Caleb Stratton'];['Ciri', 'Caleb']
51506;Baptism of Fire;And remember Zoltan Chivay and the dwarven forges.';['Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']
51507;Baptism of Fire;'You can be assured,' Geralt took the sword and buckled it across his back.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51509;Baptism of Fire;In this lousy world, Zoltan, goodness, honesty and integrity are very memorable.';['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51514;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt, we robbed a merchant in Dillingen.;['Geralt', 'Dillingen'];['Geralt']
51521;Baptism of Fire;'Why are you telling me this Zoltan?';['Zoltan'];['Zoltan']
51530;Baptism of Fire;'Goodbye, Zoltan, 'Geralt said finally.;['Zoltan', 'Geralt'];['Zoltan', 'Geralt']
51533;Baptism of Fire;I would like to introduce you to Ciri, and she would wish to meet you.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
51542;Baptism of Fire;After parting with Zoltan and his group, the Witcher recalled, we found a group of peasants wandering in the woods.;['Zoltan', 'Witcher'];['Zoltan']
51543;Baptism of Fire;Some fled at the sight of us, but Milva stopped a few, threatening them with her bow.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51570;Baptism of Fire;'We realize,' Cahir nodded.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51578;Baptism of Fire;'We can count on that,' Geralt said.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51581;Baptism of Fire;'After all they call you, Geralt of Rivia.';['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']
51591;Baptism of Fire;Vesemir considered this to be ridiculous, pretentious and stupid.;['Vesemir'];['Vesemir']
51596;Baptism of Fire;'Mine also,' Cahir hastened to explain.;['Mine', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
51597;Baptism of Fire;'Mawr is the name of my mother and my grandfather's name was Dyffryn.;['Mawr', 'Dyffryn'];['Mawr', 'Dyffryn']
51603;Baptism of Fire;'And mine,' Milva suddenly joined in the conversation, after being grim and silent, 'made me sick in the guts when I was named so I shortened it to: Maria, Mariquilla or Marieta.;['Milva', 'Maria', 'Mariquilla'];['Milva', 'Maria']
51614;Baptism of Fire;Yes, we all knew that Milva vomited at dawn.;['Milva', 'dawn'];['Milva']
51616;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion also vomited once or twice, and once Cahir got diarrhoea, and was terrified that he had caught dysentery.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51622;Baptism of Fire;When we stopped to camp in an abandoned shack, Milva took him into the forest, talking with him for a long time and often loudly.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51633;Baptism of Fire;What is wrong with Milva?;['Milva'];['Milva']
51635;Baptism of Fire;'This is not a disease,' Cahir said quietly.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51638;Baptism of Fire;Cahir nodded as a sign that he had guessed.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51640;Baptism of Fire;Geralt bit his lip.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51646;Baptism of Fire;'So forget your pathetic appeal to direct the responsibility,' Geralt said grimly, 'at any of us.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51663;Baptism of Fire;'Well, you should,' murmured Cahir.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51670;Baptism of Fire;'The medicine that she is asking for,' Cahir said quietly, 'is not a miracle cure.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51680;Baptism of Fire;And you, Geralt?' 'What about me?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51683;Baptism of Fire;'In Nilfgaard,' Cahir said, blushing and lowering his head, 'such matters are determined solely by the woman.;['Nilfgaard', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
51685;Baptism of Fire;Regis said that Milva is determined to take the... medicine.;['Regis', 'Milva'];['Milva']
51696;Baptism of Fire;If Milva decides to...' 'Shut up, Dandelion,' the Witcher growled.'Be so kind as to shut up.';['Milva', 'Dandelion', 'Witcher'];['Milva', 'Dandelion']
51720;Baptism of Fire;Right, Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51729;Baptism of Fire;'I do not understand at all.Cahir?;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51734;Baptism of Fire;'Aha.Geralt understands, Cahir think he understands.;['Geralt', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']
51782;Baptism of Fire;Geralt hugged her.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51805;Baptism of Fire;'Milva...' 'Maria.;['Maria'];['Maria']
51806;Baptism of Fire;I'm Maria, not Milva.;['Maria', 'Milva'];['Maria', 'Milva']
51810;Baptism of Fire;For fate betrayed those humans and Milva laughed...;['Milva'];['Milva']
51812;Baptism of Fire;That blood, like a wasp's venom, now eats Milva from the inside.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51813;Baptism of Fire;Maria pays for Milva.';['Maria', 'Milva'];['Maria', 'Milva']
51863;Baptism of Fire;Because I want you to find Ciri, witcher.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
51874;Baptism of Fire;Milva, I cannot help you.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51896;Baptism of Fire;*** When they left at dawn, Milva was at the head of the company, calm and smiling.;['dawn', 'Milva'];['Milva']
51898;Baptism of Fire;Regis and Geralt were bringing up the rear â€“ at one point the vampire looked over at the witcher, smiled and nodded with approval and admiration.;['Regis', 'Geralt', 'one'];['Geralt']
51900;Baptism of Fire;He then pulled from his doctor's bag a small dark glass bottle and showed it to Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51903;Baptism of Fire;*** When they stopped to water the horses, Geralt pulled Regis aside into a secluded spot.;['Geralt', 'Regis'];['Geralt']
51912;Baptism of Fire;First, the condition in which Milva finds herself is not a disease or disability.;['First', 'Milva'];['Milva']
51915;Baptism of Fire;The hormones...' 'Drop the mentoring tone,' Geralt interrupted.;['Drop', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
51917;Baptism of Fire;'That was the first thing,' reminded Regis, 'the second is that if Milva realises you are being overprotective, treating her like a plaything and sheltering her like an egg, she is simply going to get mad.;['first', 'Regis', 'second', 'Milva'];['Milva']
51919;Baptism of Fire;Geralt, I do not want to be a mentor.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51922;Baptism of Fire;'And there is a third issue,' Regis said, his eyes still drilling into Geralt.;['third', 'Regis', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
51926;Baptism of Fire;That we want to get the information as quick as possible and be off to rescue Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
51927;Baptism of Fire;'Yes,' Geralt looked away.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51929;Baptism of Fire;I want to save and recover Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
51948;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt,' the vampire said, still not taking his eyes from the witcher.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
51955;Baptism of Fire;'Not a word to Milva and the others.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51962;Baptism of Fire;When he heard them coming, he hid in a thicket, but Milva easily tracked down his hiding place and pulled him out by his collar.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51972;Baptism of Fire;'I can kill you,' Milva said with clenched teeth.;['Milva'];['Milva']
51978;Baptism of Fire;'This would be wise,' Cahir said, stroking the hilt of his sword.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
51985;Baptism of Fire;Some of the horses, especially Roach, were stubborn and refused to embark, but the ferryman and his assistant managed to get them aboard.;['Roach'];['Roach']
51993;Baptism of Fire;Geralt also felt a strange exhilaration, as if at any moment from the alders on the left bank Ciri would emerge and he would shout with joy at the sight.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
51998;Baptism of Fire;Geralt looked in the indicated direction and cursed.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52008;Baptism of Fire;'It is not the imperials,' Cahir said.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52023;Baptism of Fire;'Dandelion is right,' Cahir said grimly.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52035;Baptism of Fire;Two flew straight at Dandelion, but the Witcher already with his sword in hand, jumped and with two quick blows, deflected the arrows.;['Two', 'two'];['Two']
52036;Baptism of Fire;'By the Great Sun,' Cahir gasped.;['the Great Sun', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
52038;Baptism of Fire;Two arrows!;['Two'];['Two']
52053;Baptism of Fire;Milva, Cahir and the witcher supported the efforts of the ferryman and his assistant.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
52059;Baptism of Fire;The horses continued to stamp and neigh, shaking the vampire and Dandelion, who were holding the reins.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
52061;Baptism of Fire;Geralt could distinguish among them a knight on a white horse, waving a sword and giving orders.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52072;Baptism of Fire;'They have us in range,' Milva said in sombre tone.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52083;Baptism of Fire;'This time...' Cahir said, wiping the sweat from his brow.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52085;Baptism of Fire;Geralt also saw it.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52097;Baptism of Fire;When after a few moments of straining with the spar, Geralt looked up and saw pine boughs over his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52099;Baptism of Fire;Another was heading straight for Cahir, which the witcher deflected with a slash of his sword.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52100;Baptism of Fire;Milva, Cahir, the ferryman and his assistant, no longer pushed from the bottom, but from the shore and the slope.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
52101;Baptism of Fire;Geralt threw down his sword and sized a spar to help them, and the ferry began to drift back towards the center of the river.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52108;Baptism of Fire;Geralt saw the arrowhead and four inches of the shaft protruding from his back.;['Geralt', 'four inches'];['Geralt']
52109;Baptism of Fire;Cahir's chestnut reared on two legs and whinnied with pain, snorted and shook its neck that was pierced by an arrow, it knocked down Dandelion and jumped overboard.;['Cahir', 'two'];['Cahir']
52116;Baptism of Fire;Milva also saw this.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52125;Baptism of Fire;But not for Milva's bow.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52136;Baptism of Fire;Geralt and the archer turned around.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52144;Baptism of Fire;Everyone, including Dandelion, rushed to the spars.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
52146;Baptism of Fire;'Well,' said Milva, panting and releasing the spar.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52151;Baptism of Fire;'It will not hit,' Milva estimated with the look of an experienced archer.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52156;Baptism of Fire;'It will not hit,' Milva repeated while she adjusting the guard on her left forearm.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52163;Baptism of Fire;Milva raised her bow, stood with legs apart, quickly pulled the string to her cheek and lowered it gently, without changing position a fraction of an inch.;['Milva', 'a fraction of an inch'];['Milva']
52168;Baptism of Fire;'The other troops behind us,' Cahir pointed to the right bank.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52177;Baptism of Fire;On the left bank, closer now, near the edge of the river stood a line of riders Dandelion had identified as the Lyrian guerrillas.;['Dandelion', 'Lyrian'];['Dandelion']
52179;Baptism of Fire;Geralt saw among them a rider on a white horse.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52187;Baptism of Fire;'The battle,' Cahir evaluated in two words.;['Cahir', 'two'];['Cahir']
52192;Baptism of Fire;'The solution to this trap,' Geralt spat into the water, 'was this ferry.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52217;Baptism of Fire;Geralt was beginning to hope that everything would end well when he saw before them a wooden bridge that connected the two banks.;['Geralt', 'two'];['Geralt']
52224;Baptism of Fire;'On the bridge,' Cahir said, shading his eyes with his hands, 'is an army.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52229;Baptism of Fire;'Nilfgaard,' Cahir said dryly.;['Nilfgaard', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
52246;Baptism of Fire;Cahir, Milva and Regis hid behind the rail just in time.;['Milva', 'Regis'];['Milva']
52247;Baptism of Fire;Geralt reached for his sword and deflected a bolt, but there were still many more bolts.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52251;Baptism of Fire;It fell kicking its legs and struck Milva, and Regis's bay stallion.;['Milva', 'Regis'];['Milva']
52252;Baptism of Fire;Roach shot in the withers reared up and jumped overboard.;['Roach'];['Roach']
52259;Baptism of Fire;Milva was the last, for her movement suddenly became frighteningly slow.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52264;Baptism of Fire;Geralt saw the legs of her wool trousers darken with blood.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52270;Baptism of Fire;'No,' said Milva.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52274;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52276;Baptism of Fire;The Witcher, seeing what the vampire was doing to Milva, turned his head in embarrassment.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52290;Baptism of Fire;'Not our only,' Cahir said.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52291;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt, to the bridge.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52293;Baptism of Fire;If the Nordlings can hold the right side of the bridge, we can get Milva to the left bank.';['Nordlings', 'Milva'];['Milva']
52297;Baptism of Fire;Once on the bridge Cahir showed that he indeed had experience in controlling panic among the troops.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52303;Baptism of Fire;Some of those fleeing â€“ far from all â€“ stopped at the terrifying roars and the sight of Cahir waving his bright sword.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52305;Baptism of Fire;But Geralt also drew his sword and joined the show.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52315;Baptism of Fire;Dandelion cried, climbing onto the bridge and emitting a voice Geralt had not heard before.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52327;Baptism of Fire;Your comrades,' Cahir shouted, shaking his sword, 'still fight at the shore and on the bridge!;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52333;Baptism of Fire;You have to help Regis get Milva to the left bank.;['Regis', 'Milva'];['Milva']
52336;Baptism of Fire;Cahir yelled, brandishing his sword.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52346;Baptism of Fire;Cahir cursed.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52349;Baptism of Fire;'What you started, you need to finish,' Geralt growled, clutching his sword in his hand.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52352;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt,' Cahir stopped, and looked at the Witcher uncertainly.;['Geralt', 'Cahir', 'Witcher'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']
52357;Baptism of Fire;'This is for Milva.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52372;Baptism of Fire;Cahir slashed two with swift strokes of his long sword.;['Cahir', 'two'];['Cahir']
52373;Baptism of Fire;Geralt also struck two with Sihil.;['Geralt', 'two', 'Sihil'];['Geralt']
52381;Baptism of Fire;The uproarious army pushed onto the opposite shore, howling and pushing Geralt and Cahir, the accidental commanders, not letting them do what they wanted to do.;['Geralt', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']
52382;Baptism of Fire;Which was to withdraw stealthily, back to Milva and move her to the left bank.;['Milva'];['Milva']
52390;Baptism of Fire;For Geralt, this was something he did not know a lot about, a whole new battle.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52401;Baptism of Fire;The situation was saved by Cahir.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52403;Baptism of Fire;They had separated from Geralt's group, but now returned.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52406;Baptism of Fire;Geralt arranged his fingers and hit the burning pile with the sign of Aard.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52417;Baptism of Fire;I had to pass through a baptism of fire to save Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
52423;Baptism of Fire;Cahir!;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52425;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52426;Baptism of Fire;Cahir pulled another Nilfgaardian from his saddle.;['Cahir', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Cahir']
52431;Baptism of Fire;Cahir parried a blow from his long sword, but fell off of his horse's rump.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52435;Baptism of Fire;'Cahir!';['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52438;Baptism of Fire;'Morteisen...' Cahir, stretched on the ground, said in a voice no less astonished.;['Morteisen'];['Morteisen']
52439;Baptism of Fire;A dwarvern mercenary, who ran alongside Geralt, dressing in a doublet that was burned and charred, lost no time in amazement at all.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52476;Baptism of Fire;Cahir had disappeared somewhere.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
52482;Baptism of Fire;Geralt raised his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52489;Baptism of Fire;'Stand up, sir,' one of the knights, standing next to Geralt whispered.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52521;Baptism of Fire;The knight in purple bowed, and then looked at Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52526;Baptism of Fire;'Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']

52544;Baptism of Fire;Geralt felt a blow on the shoulder blade.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
52546;Baptism of Fire;Meve spit, thick and red, pressed a handkerchief to her face and winked at him from over the lace.;['Meve'];['Meve']
52549;Baptism of Fire;'Slufilie,' Meve nodded.;['Meve'];['Meve']
52551;Baptism of Fire;'You held the bridge together with the soldiers of Rivia, valiant Geralt of nowhere.;['Rivia', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']

52653;The Tower of the Swallow;At Triss' silent question, she shook her head.;['Triss'];['Triss']
52663;The Tower of the Swallow;Go to sleep, Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
52667;The Tower of the Swallow;The devil, if I know what to do!' Nenneke, the high priestess of the temple of Melitele, turned.;['Nenneke', 'Melitele'];['Nenneke']
52669;The Tower of the Swallow;*** In the south, far beyond the mountains of Amell, in Ebbing, in the country called Pereplut, in the extensive swamps formed by the intersection of the rivers Velda, Lete and Arete, a place about eight hundred miles as the crow flies from the city of Ellander and the temple of Melitele, as dawn, a nightmare abruptly woke an old hermit named Vysogota.;['Amell', 'Pereplut', 'Velda', 'Lete', 'Arete', 'about eight hundred miles', 'Melitele', 'Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52670;The Tower of the Swallow;Once awake, Vysogota could not remember any of the content of the dream, but a strange uneasiness kept him from falling back to sleep.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52671;The Tower of the Swallow;*** 'Cold, cold, cold, brrr,' Vysogota said to himself as he walked along a path through the bushes.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52676;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota cleaned the mud and the algae covering the trap, muttering curses and sniffing his nose.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52684;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota had no desire to even curse.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52690;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota paid no attention to the birds.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52698;The Tower of the Swallow;And yet the neighing â€“ Vysogota heard again â€“ came precisely from one of these groves.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52700;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota did not know much about horses and their breeds, but it was an aesthetician and knew how to recognise and appreciate beauty.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52706;The Tower of the Swallow;When Vysogota came closer, the horse pricked up its ears, gracefully shook its head, turned and stamped until the earth trembled.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52711;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota threw his bag on the floor.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52717;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota bent down and at that moment the corpse groaned loudly.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52723;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota removed the hair from his face.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52732;The Tower of the Swallow;*** 'I record the following,' Vysogota dipped his pen into the ink.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52740;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota obviously did not consider everything he was saying to himself, as worthy of being written down.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52749;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota threw it a piece of bread.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52758;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota sighed heavily, dipped the pen and cleaned it on the edge of the fountain.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52763;The Tower of the Swallow;Only then did Vysogota realise that he had not written on the page, not one rune, not a single word.;['Vysogota', 'one'];['Vysogota']
52776;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota contemplated the sharp tip of the pen, after which he dipped it into the ink.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52786;The Tower of the Swallow;All the indications are that a very, very unusual person has made their way to the hut of old Vysogota...';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52788;The Tower of the Swallow;'I hope,' he muttered, 'that old Vysogota's hut does not become the end of her road.';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52789;The Tower of the Swallow;*** Vysogota bent over the parchment and even leaned on the pen, but he wrote nothing, not a single rune.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52819;The Tower of the Swallow;But alive...' Vysogota looked at the parchment, he had not written a rune or a word.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52827;The Tower of the Swallow;I, Vysogota of Corvo do not believe in the existence of the gods.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52831;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota dropped his pen, rubbed his eyes, which were swollen and itchy and rested his hands on his temples.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52838;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota, as usual, forgot to turn it around.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52842;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota coughed.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52864;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota knew that it was not from pain.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52887;The Tower of the Swallow;But she did it without Vysogota's help, who watched with interest.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52888;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota was curious â€“ and the curiosity was burning.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52894;The Tower of the Swallow;Her extraordinary green eyes, Vysogota thought again, gives her face a look of childlike innocence, which at the moment shows through her horribly maimed cheek.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52895;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota knew this kind of beauty â€“ the large eyes of an eternal child, was an appearance that produced in instinctive sympathy.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52897;The Tower of the Swallow;Yes, Vysogota knew this kind of beauty.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52916;The Tower of the Swallow;But, my name is not Falka.';['Falka'];['Falka']
52939;The Tower of the Swallow;'There is no one,' she said after a moment, Vysogota caught the change in her voice.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
52952;The Tower of the Swallow;Stefan Skellen.;['Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']
52958;The Tower of the Swallow;'My name is Ciri. ';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
52959;The Tower of the Swallow;'I will prepare a compress of monkshood, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
52974;The Tower of the Swallow;The next day Vysogota pulled out half the stitches.;['next day', 'Vysogota', 'half'];['Vysogota']
52977;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota did not protest, but accompanied her.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53002;The Tower of the Swallow;Muskrat, beaver, mink, otter and other tanning skins.;['Muskrat'];['Muskrat']
53006;The Tower of the Swallow;The black mare greeted them with a loud snort and Vysogota's goat echoed with a bleat, which echoed his great displeasure of having to share his accommodation with another tenant.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53007;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri embraced the horse's neck and patted him, stroking his mane.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53014;The Tower of the Swallow;'Well,' Ciri said through clenched teeth, while pushing the mare who was trying to stick his nose through the neck of her shirt.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53022;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota nodded, as if the answer satisfied him, clarified everything and left no doubt.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53023;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri rose with effort.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53026;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota waited in silence and lived to see.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53034;The Tower of the Swallow;*** About sunset, having previously slept for a few hours, Ciri came outside again.;['a few hours', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
53035;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota, who had just returned from the river, met her at the hedge of hazel bushes.;['Vysogota', 'hazel bushes'];['Vysogota']
53045;The Tower of the Swallow;Kelpie, my mare had oats and I do not see a field around here in sight.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
53118;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota looked on calmly.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53120;The Tower of the Swallow;But I used to be a doctor, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53135;The Tower of the Swallow;* Three days later, Vysogota took out the last of the stitches.;['Three days later', 'Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53137;The Tower of the Swallow;The surgeon's satisfaction was only marred by watching Ciri star at the scar in gloomy silence, trying different angles with a mirror and trying to hide it, without success, by throwing her hair over her cheek.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53144;The Tower of the Swallow;However, Vysogota knew there was no possibility that the scar would disappear or cease to disfigure her.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53145;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri was feeling much better, to Vysogota's amazement and satisfaction and no longer spoke of leaving.;['Ciri', 'Vysogota'];['Ciri', 'Vysogota']
53146;The Tower of the Swallow;He took the black mare, Kelpie from his the pen.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
53147;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota knew that in the north, Kelpie was a sea monster that could according to superstition take the form of horse, a dolphin or even a beautiful woman, but in its real form it looked a lot like sea weed.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
53148;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri saddled the mare and rode around the pen and hut, after which she returned Kelpie to the pen to keep company with the goat, and Ciri returned to the hut to keep Vysogota company.;['Kelpie', 'Ciri', 'Vysogota'];['Kelpie', 'Ciri', 'Vysogota']
53159;The Tower of the Swallow;In the days of Vysogota's youth, gangs were not uncommon.;['the days', 'Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53164;The Tower of the Swallow;Ha, from the time of Vysogota only one thing has changed â€“ progressive emancipation.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53166;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota did not tell her directly, but gave her a sufficiently clear note that he knew with whom he was dealing with.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53171;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota had had enough.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53196;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota threw an otter skin onto the pallet.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53201;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri winced and rubbed her scar.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53211;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota raised his eyebrows even more.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53214;The Tower of the Swallow;But you should know, sir hermit, that I have read the History of the World by Roderick de Novembre.;['the History of the World', 'Roderick de Novembre'];['Roderick']
53219;The Tower of the Swallow;"Vysogota was silent; he struggle to make sure his face did not betray anything.";['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53220;The Tower of the Swallow;'So I think,' Ciri said, throwing back her head in a move that was characteristic of her, proud and somewhat violent, 'that you are not a simpleton or a hermit.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53223;The Tower of the Swallow;'If so,' Vysogota smiled, 'then our luck has joined in a very strange way, my well-read maiden.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53225;The Tower of the Swallow;At the end of the day, you too, Ciri, are hiding.;['the end of the day', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
53226;The Tower of the Swallow;At the end of the day, you too, Ciri, deftly weave around you a veil of appearances.;['the end of the day', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
53229;The Tower of the Swallow;'Towards the world, Ciri.;"[""'Towards"", 'Ciri']";['Ciri']
53232;The Tower of the Swallow;To a world where a ragged bandit is knowledgeable, wise and may even be of noble birth, who is an intellectual and scholar who reads Roderick de Novembre and knows the seal of the Academy.;['Roderick de Novembre', 'Academy'];['Roderick']
53250;The Tower of the Swallow;'The embittered, suspicious old man,' Vysogota said after a moment of silence, 'apologizes to the educated maiden.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53278;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri calmed down, but her eyes did not lose the challenging and insolent look.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53291;The Tower of the Swallow;'Nothing is as it seems,' Ciri replied, blushing again.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53293;The Tower of the Swallow;'And how inevitably it leads to the conclusion that we, Ciri, we know nothing about each other.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53295;The Tower of the Swallow;He waited a moment, but Ciri did not hasten to say anything.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53307;The Tower of the Swallow;*** 'My name is Vysogota of Corvo.;['Vysogota', 'Corvo'];['Vysogota']
53348;The Tower of the Swallow;'So you see, dear Ciri, we are both in a similar situation.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53362;The Tower of the Swallow;To hell with your ethics, Vysogota of Corvo.;['Vysogota', 'Corvo'];['Vysogota']
53441;The Tower of the Swallow;They had surrounded him silently â€“ to the right was Asse in a black leather jacket, laced with silver threads â€“ to the left was Falka in a green suede jacket, with feathers in her beret.;['Asse', 'Falka'];['Asse', 'Falka']
53444;The Tower of the Swallow;Asse lowered his sword.;['Asse'];['Asse']
53447;The Tower of the Swallow;'That's a beautiful mare,' Falka said enthusiastically, pushing the beret off her ear.;['Falka'];['Falka']
53453;The Tower of the Swallow;'Where is Giselher?;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53454;The Tower of the Swallow;Inside?' Asse nodded.;['Asse'];['Asse']
53456;The Tower of the Swallow;'When she galloped through the water' â€“ she looked at Hotsporn with her large green eyes â€“ 'She was like the purest Kelpie!;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
53457;The Tower of the Swallow;If you would have come from the sea instead of the river, I would've sworn this was a Kelpie.';['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
53458;The Tower of the Swallow;'Has Miss Falka ever seen a real Kelpie?' 'Only once, in a picture.';['Falka', 'Kelpie'];['Falka', 'Kelpie']
53464;The Tower of the Swallow;On that table sat Mistle, leaning back on her elbows and naked from the waist down, clothed in nothing but black stockings.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
53466;The Tower of the Swallow;That could be none other than Master Alma Vera, the tattoo artist, because he was just about to bite a colourful picture into Mistle's leg.;['Alma Vera', 'Mistle'];['Mistle']
53467;The Tower of the Swallow;'Come closer,' Giselher motioned for Hotsporn to take an empty stool at the table where he sat with Spark, Kayleigh, and Reef.;['Giselher', 'Hotsporn', 'Spark', 'Kayleigh', 'Reef'];['Giselher', 'Kayleigh', 'Reef']

53472;The Tower of the Swallow;'You found our message in the ruins of the old station?' continued Giselher.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53475;The Tower of the Swallow;'Because of his beautiful mare,' interjected Falka.;['Falka'];['Falka']
53478;The Tower of the Swallow;Hotsporn did not look away from Giselher.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53497;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh emphatically confirmed, although no one had asked him for a confirmation.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53505;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher pointed to an ornate paint jar that stood between the jugs and tankards.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53507;The Tower of the Swallow;'First-class dust,' assured Giselher.;['First', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
53521;The Tower of the Swallow;The same was true with the silk cloth wrapped around the head of Giselher.;['cloth', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
53522;The Tower of the Swallow;Hotsporn had even heard of girls who cut their hair like Mistle's.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']

53534;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh noisily flushed his mouth with wine and spat on the floor.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53536;The Tower of the Swallow;He gave the jar to Falka, who repeated the ritual and passed it to Reef.;['Falka', 'Reef'];['Falka', 'Reef']
53538;The Tower of the Swallow;The elf passed it on to Giselher, without making use of it.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53541;The Tower of the Swallow;Emperor Emhyr does it to the entire world, we only to this hovel.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
53543;The Tower of the Swallow;'Owww, dammit!' cried Mistle from the table.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
53548;The Tower of the Swallow;The Rats â€“ except Falka and Giselher â€“ roared with laughter.;['The Rats', 'Falka', 'Giselher'];['Falka', 'Giselher']
53550;The Tower of the Swallow;'Don't worry, master,' added Kayleigh.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53552;The Tower of the Swallow;Falka threw a filthy curse at him, followed by a tankard.;['Falka'];['Falka']
53558;The Tower of the Swallow;'We are here in ambush', said Giselher while he rubbed Fisstech into his gums.;['Giselher', 'Fisstech'];['Giselher']
53562;The Tower of the Swallow;'But we've been here the whole day today and all we got was this', said Reef while he pointed to Master Alma Vera, whose whole head had nearly disappeared between Mistle's splayed thighs.;['the whole day', 'today', 'Reef', 'Master Alma Vera', 'Mistle'];['Reef', 'Mistle']
53568;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh also had one â€“ twisted around his arm, above the spiked bracelet, was a green snake with its mouth open and a scarlet red forked tongue.;['Kayleigh', 'one'];['Kayleigh']
53575;The Tower of the Swallow;Reef swore softly and Kayleigh began to laugh.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53587;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher shrugged his shoulders.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53589;The Tower of the Swallow;Reef, Kayleigh and Falka looked at the Hotsporn as if he had just informed them that the sun had fallen into the river and they had to fish it out quickly before it was cut to pieces by crab claws.;['Falka', 'Hotsporn'];['Falka']
53594;The Tower of the Swallow;The discussion was interrupted by Mistle, who approached them, without taking the trouble to get dressed.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
53600;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh snorted and brushed back his hair.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53603;The Tower of the Swallow;'Your turn, Falka' said Mistle. ';['Falka', 'Mistle'];['Falka', 'Mistle']
53605;The Tower of the Swallow;Falka touched her legs, leaned down and looked at the tattoo.;['Falka'];['Falka']
53608;The Tower of the Swallow;Falka began to giggle and undress without ceremony.;['Falka'];['Falka']
53611;The Tower of the Swallow;In the very same place as yours, darling.' *** 'I think you might have mice, Vysogota.';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53612;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri interrupted her story and looked at the floor, where the light from the small lamp illuminated a true tournament of mice.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53619;The Tower of the Swallow;'You have not seen this cat, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53633;The Tower of the Swallow;Go on, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53634;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri sat motionless for a moment, gazing into the fire pit.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53639;The Tower of the Swallow;*** Master Alma Vera stabbed and Ciri could feel tears gathering in the corners of her eyes.;['Alma Vera', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
53647;The Tower of the Swallow;'Not only is the governor of Amarillo hunting you, but also Varnhagen and Baron Casadei...' 'The Baron?' Giselher grimaced.;"['Amarillo', 'Varnhagen', 'Baron Casadei', ""'The Baron"", 'Giselher']";['Giselher']

53684;The Tower of the Swallow;'Exactly,' shouted Ciri from the table, who had already forgotten how afraid she had been the night before when they had been fleeing pursuers throughout the small villages by the Velde.;['Ciri', 'Velde'];['Ciri']
53691;The Tower of the Swallow;'Bonhart.' repeated Giselher slowly.;['Bonhart', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
53694;The Tower of the Swallow;'Someone rich,' confirmed Mistle. 'Not many could afford Bonhart.';['Mistle', 'Bonhart'];['Mistle']
53695;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri was about to ask what this Bonhart was, but before she had the chance the same question was spoken simultaneously by Reef and Asse.;['Ciri', 'Bonhart', 'Reef and Asse'];['Ciri']
53696;The Tower of the Swallow;'It is a bounty hunter,' explained Giselher gloomily.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53699;The Tower of the Swallow;'He is' Kayleigh said, rather carelessly, 'if everyone Bonhart has killed were buried in the same cemetery, it would be a half acre in size.';['Kayleigh', 'Bonhart', 'a half acre'];['Kayleigh']
53700;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle sprinkled a little white powder in the hollow between her thumb and forefinger, and snorted it violently up her nose.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
53703;The Tower of the Swallow;'More like he stabbed them in the back,' accused Kayleigh.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53704;The Tower of the Swallow;'He also killed Valdez', added Giselher.;['Valdez', 'Giselher'];['Valdez', 'Giselher']
53718;The Tower of the Swallow;'We,' Kayleigh said after a while, 'have beaten a squadron of six of Nilfgaardian cavalry!';['Kayleigh', 'six', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Kayleigh']

53720;The Tower of the Swallow;'Hardly anyone can compete', hissed Reef, 'with us!';['Reef'];['Reef']
53722;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher thumped himself in the chest.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53727;The Tower of the Swallow;Three of them are sitting right here â€“ Spark, Mistle and Falka.;['Three', 'Mistle', 'Falka'];['Mistle', 'Falka']
53740;The Tower of the Swallow;She looked at him askance and snuggled ostentatiously close to Mistle's shoulder.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
53745;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher said Hotsporn and he had known each other for a long time and were buddies.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53750;The Tower of the Swallow;Initially, Ciri was surprised and a little disappointed â€“ she had looked up to Giselher with admiration.;['Ciri', 'Giselher'];['Ciri', 'Giselher']
53754;The Tower of the Swallow;One hand washes the other, Mistle had said with a shrug when Ciri asked her about it.;['One', 'Mistle', 'Ciri'];['Mistle', 'Ciri']

53762;The Tower of the Swallow;'I, dear Rats,' said Hotsporn, pulling Ciri out of her reflection, 'have a cure for all your troubles.;['Rats', 'Hotsporn', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']

53767;The Tower of the Swallow;But Giselher commanded silence with a gesture and let Hotsporn continue.;['Giselher', 'Hotsporn'];['Giselher']
53771;The Tower of the Swallow;'Bullshit!' yelled Kayleigh with a slightly watery eyes, a result of the pinch of Fisstech he had just sniffed.;['Bullshit', 'Kayleigh', 'Fisstech'];['Kayleigh']

53839;The Tower of the Swallow;Also supposedly killed was Cirilla, her granddaughter, the last of the royal blood.;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
53840;The Tower of the Swallow;So Emhyr did not have much to work with to create, as Mr. Reef has so wisely identified, a puppet-state.;['Emhyr', 'Reef'];['Emhyr', 'Reef']
53841;The Tower of the Swallow;But since Cirilla has suddenly been found, the story of her death must have only been a fabrication.';['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
53842;The Tower of the Swallow;'All stories are,' snorted Spark, leaning on Giselher's shoulder.;['Spark', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
53844;The Tower of the Swallow;It is said that an evil sorceress held this Cirilla captive in a magical tower somewhere far in the north.;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
53848;The Tower of the Swallow;'That may be,' Hotsporn continued slowly, 'But Emperor Emhyr proclaimed that he fell helplessly in love with her at first sight and he now wants to take her to be his wife.';['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
53853;The Tower of the Swallow;'Right,' agreed Reef.;['Reef'];['Reef']
53865;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh grimaced.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53876;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher's teeth flashed briefly in his sun-scorched, blue-shaven visage.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53882;The Tower of the Swallow;'You're right, Giselher,' he said coolly.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53887;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh was about to speak, and Mistle also wanted to say something, but a quick glance from Giselher shut their mouths tight.;['Kayleigh', 'Mistle', 'Giselher'];['Kayleigh', 'Mistle', 'Giselher']
53899;The Tower of the Swallow;'The way you keep trying to frighten us with Bonhart,' Giselher said slowly and stood up.;['Bonhart', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
53908;The Tower of the Swallow;Good luck, Giselher.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53921;The Tower of the Swallow;'He's in Jealousy,' Giselher said quietly.;['Jealousy', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
53926;The Tower of the Swallow;'The same as you,' growled Kayleigh.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53928;The Tower of the Swallow;'Avenge Valdez,' said Reef. ';['Reef'];['Reef']
53935;The Tower of the Swallow;'There will be songs sung about us at fairs,' Kayleigh said ardently.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53937;The Tower of the Swallow;Asse pounded his fist on the table.;['Asse'];['Asse']
53939;The Tower of the Swallow;'And afterwards', considered Giselher, 'we will think over this amnesty...over the guild...;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53940;The Tower of the Swallow;What's wrong with you Kayleigh, you look as though you've swallowed a bug?;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
53948;The Tower of the Swallow;'Let's drink,' said Giselher.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
53954;The Tower of the Swallow;'Look to Mistle and Falka for an example.;['Falka'];['Falka']
53957;The Tower of the Swallow;*** Ciri raised her head and remained silent a long time, gazing at the barely glowing flames of the lamp, in which the last of the remaining oil burned.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53965;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota yawned.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
53976;The Tower of the Swallow;'We have time, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
53985;The Tower of the Swallow;Understand that, Mistle.';['Mistle'];['Mistle']
53990;The Tower of the Swallow;'I'll never forget you, Mistle.';['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54006;The Tower of the Swallow;'That would require a lot of power,' sighed Mistle. ';['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54008;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri licked her lips.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54011;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle turned her close-cropped head away and looked at the blue and pink stripes, which the dawn was already painting on the eastern edge of the world.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54021;The Tower of the Swallow;Even if Giselher and the others don't want it...;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
54029;The Tower of the Swallow;'I love you, Mistle.';['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54036;The Tower of the Swallow;When he assumed that any 'Cirilla' would become the wife of the Emperor of Nilfgaard.;['Cirilla', 'Nilfgaard'];['Cirilla']
54056;The Tower of the Swallow;Do you understand, Vysogota?';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54069;The Tower of the Swallow;Do you understand Vysogota?';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54075;The Tower of the Swallow;Do you understand Vysogota?';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54091;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota finally asked.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54093;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri wiped her forehead with her sleeve.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54097;The Tower of the Swallow;*** 'Miss Falka!';['Falka'];['Falka']
54105;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri rode closer, so close that their stirrups almost touched.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54128;The Tower of the Swallow;'The Yarra River,' said Ciri slowly, 'which you spoke of in the station...;"[""'The Yarra River"", 'Ciri']";['Ciri']
54135;The Tower of the Swallow;'And the mouth of this river,' continued Ciri, 'is in Cintra?';['Ciri', 'Cintra'];['Ciri']
54145;The Tower of the Swallow;'It appears Miss Falka is very interested in this Cintra.;['Falka', 'Cintra'];['Falka']
54157;The Tower of the Swallow;'Hmm...' Ciri stared at the misty horizon, blurred with lines of black hills.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54165;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri gave him the coldest look she had.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54170;The Tower of the Swallow;'Bravo, Miss Falka.;['Falka'];['Falka']
54183;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri watched enviously.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54192;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri did not like the looks he gave her or his eloquent smile, and least of all the slightly mocking tone in which he asked or answered questions.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54199;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri laughed uproariously.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54210;The Tower of the Swallow;You're an innocent victim, Falka.;['Falka'];['Falka']
54213;The Tower of the Swallow;It's not your fault that one of the female bandits, Mistle, had an eye for you, her unnatural tendencies are well known.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54214;The Tower of the Swallow;You have been subjugated by Mistle, sexually exploited and forced to...' 'Well, there I'm going to have to interrupt you, yes,' Ciri was surprised by her calm voice.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54217;The Tower of the Swallow;'Really?' 'Like every cockerel' â€“ she was still speaking calmly â€“ 'Your crest swells at the thought of Mistle and me.;"[""'Your crest"", 'Mistle']";['Mistle']
54222;The Tower of the Swallow;'My thoughts, dear Falka,' he said after a while, 'might not be decent, might not be pretty, might not be... pah, they obviously aren't innocent...;['Falka'];['Falka']
54243;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri turned side to side in the saddle, struggling with a strange sensation that had suddenly arisen in her, somewhere deep inside, in the lower abdomen.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54245;The Tower of the Swallow;I told him the truth, thought Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54253;The Tower of the Swallow;He knows, Ciri thought, he old bastard knows what I feel.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54261;The Tower of the Swallow;Yennefer had taught her â€“ count in advance and with a cool head, because later, when things heat up, the head takes on a strange reluctance for calculating, along with an inclination to take consequences too lightly.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
54263;The Tower of the Swallow;If only he were not so old, Ciri secretly sighed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54273;The Tower of the Swallow;The dog Bello, the cat Mohrle, and the girl â€“ Marie!' 'Quite right.';['Mohrle', 'Marie'];['Marie']
54288;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri pressed herself flat, almost down to her horse's neck, because the branches whipping at her threatened to pull her from the saddle.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54295;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri did not hesitate.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54304;The Tower of the Swallow;whispered Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54349;The Tower of the Swallow;'Falka,' he said in a grave tone.;['Falka'];['Falka']
54368;The Tower of the Swallow;'You told Giselher...' 'Forget Giselher.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
54377;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri pushed away his hand.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54398;The Tower of the Swallow;Oh, what the hell, Ciri thought.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54426;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri turned her head to the side.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54429;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota was not sure.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54458;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri could not suppress a sigh of admiration when she saw her neck, straight and slim but very muscular, the small, well-shaped forehead, the high withers, and the admirably well-proportioned physique.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54459;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri approached the mare cautiously and showed her the bracelet on her wrist.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54460;The Tower of the Swallow;The mare snorted and pricked her ears up, but allowed Ciri to take the bridle and stroke her velvety nose.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54461;The Tower of the Swallow;'Kelpie' said Ciri.;['Kelpie', 'Ciri'];['Kelpie', 'Ciri']
54462;The Tower of the Swallow;'You're as black and smart as a Kelpie from the sea.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
54463;The Tower of the Swallow;You are magical like a Kelpie.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
54464;The Tower of the Swallow;So you shall be called Kelpie.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
54467;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri, who was used to riding in a high saddle, shortened the stirrup straps and stroked the unusually shallow, wooden framed saddle with no saddle horn.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54469;The Tower of the Swallow;'Calm down, Kelpie.';['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
54472;The Tower of the Swallow;'Now,' said Ciri as she patted the mare's warm neck, 'we'll see if you're fiery as well.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54474;The Tower of the Swallow;What do you think of a gallop of twenty miles, Kelpie?';['twenty miles', 'Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
54480;The Tower of the Swallow;The cabin of old Vysogota was well hidden in the reeds of the marsh.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54482;The Tower of the Swallow;*** 'The valley with the stream was even and well suited for riding, so Kelpie ran like a whirlwind.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
54485;The Tower of the Swallow;I recalled what Hotsporn said to Giselher in the station.;['Hotsporn', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
54488;The Tower of the Swallow;As soon as Giselher had dismissed the offer of amnesty and work for the guild, Hotsporn had specifically reminded him of the bounty hunter who had taken up quarters in the town.;['Giselher', 'Hotsporn'];['Giselher']
54495;The Tower of the Swallow;'I can imagine,' muttered Vysogota, 'that you did not succeed.';['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54528;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher warned loudly, so that all could hear him.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
54537;The Tower of the Swallow;'If he's in there', muttered Kayleigh.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
54544;The Tower of the Swallow;The morning is best, because everyone is still sober, isn't that right, Giselher?' Giselher did not answer.;['The morning', 'Giselher', 'Giselher'];['Giselher', 'Giselher']
54559;The Tower of the Swallow;'And where is Falka?';['Falka'];['Falka']
54572;The Tower of the Swallow;Why?' 'Yes, for Toadstool,' said Kayleigh.;['Toadstool', 'Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
54575;The Tower of the Swallow;And so we have peace,' put in Reef.;['Reef'];['Reef']
54591;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh cried and tensed slightly.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
54605;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh clenched his jaw and Mistle leaned forward, ready to pounce.;['Kayleigh', 'Mistle'];['Kayleigh', 'Mistle']
54606;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher grabbed her by the shoulder.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
54626;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh went furthest to the left, almost to the wall of a distillery.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
54628;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle, Asse and Reef went to the right.;['Asse', 'Reef'];['Asse', 'Reef']
54629;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher remained in the centre and scrutinized the bounty hunter with squinted eyes.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
54639;The Tower of the Swallow;Reef was the first thrown out of the fray, he bounced back against a wall and his blood splattered the dirty white mortar.;['Reef', 'first'];['Reef']
54640;The Tower of the Swallow;Then Asse broke off from the group with tottering steps, doubled over and fell on his side, writhing and clutching his knee.;['Asse'];['Asse']
54648;The Tower of the Swallow;The bounty hunter beat back Mistle's and Giselher's wide, sweeping attacks, then he spun around and, with a lightning-quick strike from his sword tip, slit Kayleigh open â€“ from collarbone to hip.;['Mistle', 'Giselher', 'Kayleigh'];['Mistle', 'Giselher', 'Kayleigh']
54649;The Tower of the Swallow;Kayleigh dropped his sword, but did not notice â€“ he just crouched and grabbed his chest and abdomen with both hands, blood gushing from under his palms.;['Kayleigh'];['Kayleigh']
54650;The Tower of the Swallow;Bonhart dodged Giselher's blow with another spin, parried Mistle's attack and dealt another blow to Kayleigh, which turned one side of his head into scarlet pulp.;['Giselher', 'Mistle', 'Kayleigh'];['Giselher', 'Mistle', 'Kayleigh']
54652;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle and Giselher hesitated for a moment.;['Giselher'];['Giselher']
54657;The Tower of the Swallow;*** Bonhart smashed his heel against Giselher, who was on the wall.;['Bonhart', 'Giselher'];['Giselher']
54660;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle, who was on her knees looking for her sword, ran both hands through mud and mire without realizing that she was kneeling in a rapidly growing red puddle.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54664;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri launched herself from the running horse, stumbled, and fell to one knee.;['Ciri', 'one'];['Ciri']
54670;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle found her sword, but was not able to lift it.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54674;The Tower of the Swallow;But Mistle, who was holding her ripped open stomach, got back up.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54675;The Tower of the Swallow;'Noooo' yelled Ciri.;['Noooo', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
54678;The Tower of the Swallow;He swung wide and struck with a powerful, sweeping blow, as with a scythe, so that Mistle was pulled up from the ground and thrown against the wall, like a soft cloth doll, like a red smeared rag.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54679;The Tower of the Swallow;The cry in Ciri's throat died.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54687;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri approached him and traced a semicircle around him.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54693;The Tower of the Swallow;But it didn't matter to Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54702;The Tower of the Swallow;* Six days later, Nycklar, the son of the coffin maker, told the story, 'I really don't know how it was that they didn't kill each other at that first meeting.;['Six days later', 'Nycklar', 'first'];['Nycklar']
54709;The Tower of the Swallow;And they danced and jumped around each other like two weasels!' Stefan Skellen, called The Owl, listened intently as he played with his riding whip.;['two', 'Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']
54718;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri breathed heavily.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54734;The Tower of the Swallow;Lambert.;['Lambert'];['Lambert']
54747;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri clutched her head, feeling a dull pain, but there was no wound under her fingers, no blood.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54758;The Tower of the Swallow;Immediately he dragged her away, screaming, to the wall Mistle was lying by.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
54767;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri squirmed and writhed, but his hand held her in place and before long her only movements were twitching and dry retching.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54770;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri smelled the sharp, penetrating odour of urine.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54775;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri slumped down to her hands and feet, shaking with sobs.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54777;The Tower of the Swallow;Mistle's hand, the slender, delicate, soft, clever hands of Mistle... ...did not move.;['Mistle', 'Mistle'];['Mistle', 'Mistle']
54780;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota sat there motionless.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54794;The Tower of the Swallow;That they did not decompose...' Ciri's voice cracked, her words stuck in her dry throat.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54795;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota, who knew at once what he was about to hear, felt the bile rising in his throat like a flood.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']
54796;The Tower of the Swallow;'He cut their heads off,' Ciri said flatly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
54798;The Tower of the Swallow;Giselher, Kayleigh, Asse, Reef, Spark... And Mistle.;['Giselher', 'Asse', 'Reef'];['Giselher', 'Asse', 'Reef']
54821;The Tower of the Swallow;The forces in that armed conflict were: the Army of Nilfgaard, The Army Corps of Lyria â€“ led by Queen Meve, and us, our wonderful company â€“ myself, the writer of these lines, the witcher Geralt, the vampire Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, the archer Maria Barring , called Milva, and Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a Nilfgaardian who tended to stress, with an obstinacy that was worthy a better cause, that he was not a Nilfgaardian.;['The Army \r\nCorps of Lyria', 'Queen Meve', 'Geralt', 'Emiel Regis', 'Terzieff-Godefroy', 'Maria Barring', 'Milva', 'Cahir Mawr Dyffryn', 'Nilfgaardian', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Geralt', 'Milva']
54823;The Tower of the Swallow;Meve was not, however, killed in battle as was supposed, nor even taken into Nilfgaardian captivity.;['Meve', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Meve']
54824;The Tower of the Swallow;After they had regrouped, the brave Meve and a large portion of the survivors of the Lyrian Army recruited everyone they could, including mercenaries and ordinary bandits, and launched a guerrilla war against Nilfgaard.;['Meve', 'the Lyrian Army', 'Nilfgaard'];['Meve']
54828;The Tower of the Swallow;Meve's Crowd â€“ which the army of the White Queen became known as â€“ grew rapidly in strength and developed such bravado that they fearlessly crossed to the left bank of the Yaruga, deep behind enemy lines, in order to camp and harass the enemy to their heart's desire.;['Meve', 'Yaruga'];['Meve']
54837;The Tower of the Swallow;For now I am relying on the authority of Cahir aep Ceallach, the only soldier in our company â€“ and Cahir has confirmed that, from the perspective of most military doctrines, winning a battle through the rapid escape of the battlefield is allowed.;['Cahir', 'Cahir'];['Cahir', 'Cahir']
54842;The Tower of the Swallow;The exception was the witcher Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
54843;The Tower of the Swallow;Because, contrary to his often proclaimed â€“ and, as you can see, hypocritical â€“ indifferent attitude and his often declared neutrality, the witcher Geralt displayed equally large and overly-spectacular zeal on the battlefield.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
54847;The Tower of the Swallow;You must know, dear reader, that the witcher Geralt was always a modest, uncomplicated, balanced, and controlled man, who kept his feelings to himself and was as straightforward as a halberd shaft.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
54849;The Tower of the Swallow;Rather than quickly and anonymously vanishing from the scene, Geralt rode around in the royal camp, delighting in the honour, enjoying the patronage and basking in the glory.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
54851;The Tower of the Swallow;To those to who have forgotten, I call to mind that the afore-mentioned witcher Geralt, now knighted, was wanted in connection to the uprising on Thanedd, the island of magicians, by the intelligence services of all four kingdoms.;['Geralt', 'Thanedd', 'four'];['Geralt']
54853;The Tower of the Swallow;In addition was Milva who, as it turned out, had collaborated with the Dryads and the Scioa'tael and had been involved in the infamous massacres of people on the edges of Brokilon Forest.;['Milva', 'Brokilon Forest'];['Milva']
54858;The Tower of the Swallow;When I strongly reminded Geralt of this, his face darkened a little, but he presented his motives to me, of which he had two.;['Geralt', 'two'];['Geralt']
54859;The Tower of the Swallow;First, Milva still needed nursing and care after her unfortunate accident and there were field medics with the army.;['First', 'Milva'];['Milva']
54861;The Tower of the Swallow;Before our company had been forced to change direction and had been caught in the battle described above, we had also been travelling east, towards Caed Dhu â€“ because we were hoping the Druids who live there could give us information that would be useful in the search for Ciri.;['Caed Dhu', 'Druids', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
54868;The Tower of the Swallow;As one can easily imagine, Geralt did not like this change of direction â€“ he wanted to reach the Druids as quickly as possible, not Mahakam!;['Geralt', 'Druids', 'Mahakam'];['Geralt']
54872;The Tower of the Swallow;The still-ailing Milva, the vampire Regis and the author of these lines were advised to join the column of refugees and civilians who followed the camp.;['Milva', 'Regis'];['Milva']
54877;The Tower of the Swallow;As soon as Milva learned of the development of things, she immediately declared herself to be healthy and fit for travel â€“ and issued the watchword to escape at the first opportunity.;['Milva', 'first'];['Milva']
54878;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir threw the royal colours in the bushes and disappeared from the Free Company, and advised Geralt to do the same from the exquisite luxury tents of the knighthood.;['Cahir', 'the Free \r\nCompany', 'Geralt'];['Cahir', 'Geralt']
54885;The Tower of the Swallow;Apart from Milva's tragic accident and the numerous injuries and wounds Geralt and Cahir had sustained, all of our horses had been killed or maimed in the battle â€“ excepting my trusty Pegasus and the wayward Roach, the mare of the witcher.;['Milva', 'Geralt', 'Cahir', 'Pegasus', 'Roach'];['Milva', 'Geralt', 'Cahir', 'Pegasus', 'Roach']
54888;The Tower of the Swallow;As Milva noted before we started, if you steal in the dark, you don't know what you are getting.;['Milva'];['Milva']
54906;The Tower of the Swallow;The father of the concept to travel the left bank was the witcher Geralt, who, after resigning from the brotherhood of knightly braggarts, had recovered a considerable extent of his rational, logical thinking and his usual caution.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
54912;The Tower of the Swallow;Two whole days we sat in a willow thicket by the river, cultivating rheumatism and feeding the mosquitoes.;['Two'];['Two']
54919;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt had earlier acquired the habit of calculating the days he had been separated from Ciri â€“ and every day that he was not travelling, as he said, separated them more and more.;['Geralt', 'the days'];['Geralt']
54922;The Tower of the Swallow;You must know, dear reader, that Geralt's bone had been shattered during the conference of mages on Thanedd.;['Geralt', 'Thanedd'];['Geralt']
54931;The Tower of the Swallow;The usually eloquent vampire dismissed him with a shrug, Milva spat, and Cahir dryly recalled that he had already attempted to travel alone, but, in regards the risk, said that he who wears the sword should not complain about the belt.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
54935;The Tower of the Swallow;I confess that I worried about the operation â€“ the plan called for, namely, crossing the river at night while swimming, or, as Milva and Cahir put it, 'being towed by the horse's cocks'.;['night', 'Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
54936;The Tower of the Swallow;Even if they were speaking metaphorically â€“ and I suspect that they were â€“ I could not imagine myself on such a crossing on my gelding Pegasus, on whose cock I would have to rely.;['Pegasus'];['Pegasus']
54939;The Tower of the Swallow;The same thing was true of Pegasus.;['Pegasus'];['Pegasus']
54947;The Tower of the Swallow;Only once were we questioned by a sentry, who Cahir, with a domineering frown, bluffed with the threat of some imperial service, underscoring his words with the traditional military and always effective salutation of 'son of a bitch'.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
54950;The Tower of the Swallow;At the first camp in the woods of Riverdell, I also had a strange dream â€“ unlike Geralt I dreamed not of Ciri, but of the sorceress Yennefer.;['first', 'Riverdell', 'Geralt', 'Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Geralt', 'Ciri', 'Yennefer']
54951;The Tower of the Swallow;The dream was strange, worrisome â€“ Yennefer was dressed, as usual, in black and white and flew through the air over a dark, small, mountain castle, while other sorceresses underneath her shook their fists at her and shouted insults.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
54952;The Tower of the Swallow;Yennefer waved the long sleeves of her dress and flew away like a black albatross, out into a boundless sea, opposite the rising sun.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
54957;The Tower of the Swallow;I kept my dream from Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
54960;The Tower of the Swallow;*** 'Yennefer, she was called!;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

54977;The Tower of the Swallow;Triss had a waist circumference of twenty-two inches.;['Triss', 'twenty-two'];['Triss']
55000;The Tower of the Swallow;'The Black Hair in the nets,' continued the woman from the islands, 'coughs, spits water, and pulls the net, and Gudrun, nervous because she is pregnant, starts screaming, 'A Kelpie!;['The Black Hair', 'Gudrun', 'Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
55001;The Tower of the Swallow;A Kelpie!;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
55005;The Tower of the Swallow;But Skadi, the daughter of Una, who can't think for herself, also starts crying, 'A Kelpie!', and already she reaches for a boat hook!;['Una', 'Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
55028;The Tower of the Swallow;And she says to call her by her name: Yennefer of Vengerberg.';['Yennefer', 'Vengerberg'];['Yennefer']
55031;The Tower of the Swallow;Especially the famous Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
55041;The Tower of the Swallow;Later, when she killed herself, I even felt sorry for her...' 'Yennefer is no longer alive?' called Triss who, in her fright, forgot her secret mission and the fact that she was supposed to be incognito.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
55042;The Tower of the Swallow;'Yennefer of Vengerberg is no longer alive?';['Yennefer', 'Vengerberg'];['Yennefer']
55053;The Tower of the Swallow;Thus we rode, dear reader, through the forests of Riverdell, to the east, towards Caed Dhu, in search of the druids that could help us find Ciri.;['Riverdell', 'Caed \r\nDhu', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
55060;The Tower of the Swallow;Initially I noticed that Milva and Cahir tended to timidly rub their necks after waking, but they stopped that quickly.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
55068;The Tower of the Swallow;Thanks to Milva, however, no one got seriously upset by this.;['Milva'];['Milva']
55069;The Tower of the Swallow;In contrast to Geralt and Cahir, who seemed to be prompted to adopt the style of the vampire and even to compete with him in this regard, the archer Milva enacted a simple and unpretentious solution.;['Geralt', 'Cahir', 'Milva'];['Geralt', 'Cahir', 'Milva']
55073;The Tower of the Swallow;I have the impression that Milva was having difficulty coping with her tragic accident and loss.;['Milva'];['Milva']
55093;The Tower of the Swallow;The Nilfgaardian moved away from the poet and, after a brief reflection, grabbed his saddle and blanket coat, and pulled them closer to Milva, who appeared to be dozing.;['Nilfgaardian', 'Milva'];['Milva']
55102;The Tower of the Swallow;'I've already apologized,' Cahir reminded him dryly, as he set up his camp at the new location.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55117;The Tower of the Swallow;'No,' said Geralt as he moved closer to the fire and threw a blanket over his shoulders.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
55130;The Tower of the Swallow;'A silly title,' Cahir said dryly.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55159;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt massaged his aching knee and bent it carefully.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
55172;The Tower of the Swallow;Milva unexpectedly said and stuck her head out from under her blanket.;['Milva'];['Milva']
55176;The Tower of the Swallow;We are on an expedition to come to the aid Ciri, going into an enemy country with weapons in our hands.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
55177;The Tower of the Swallow;It may be that Dandelion's scribblings fall into the enemy's hands.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
55180;The Tower of the Swallow;'You are exaggerating, Milva,' the vampire said mildly.;['Milva'];['Milva']
55181;The Tower of the Swallow;'Indeed, and strongly,' claimed Dandelion.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
55182;The Tower of the Swallow;'It also seems to me you are exaggerating,' said Cahir added carelessly.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55184;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt gave him a sidelong look and, with a loud crash, broke the branch with which he had played.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
55187;The Tower of the Swallow;Maria, I also think you are exaggerating.;['Maria'];['Maria']
55188;The Tower of the Swallow;Dandelion's scribbling has no meaning, as usual.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
55196;The Tower of the Swallow;Milva threw off the blanket and sat down by the fire, finally giving up on sleeping.;['Milva'];['Milva']
55197;The Tower of the Swallow;It looked, Geralt noticed, like it would once again be a long night of conversation.;['Geralt', 'a long night'];['Geralt']
55198;The Tower of the Swallow;'You did not like your stepfather, I take it,' said Dandelion after a short silence.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
55211;The Tower of the Swallow;*** It was strange that Milva had joined us and astonishing that the vampire kept us company.;['Milva'];['Milva']
55212;The Tower of the Swallow;But the strangest â€“ and absolutely incomprehensible â€“ motives were from Cahir, who suddenly went from an enemy to something like a friend, or at least an ally.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55216;The Tower of the Swallow;For although Geralt had fought shoulder to shoulder with Cahir, and although he had stood at his side, facing death, he still looked at the Nilfgaardian suspiciously and never considered him with favour.;['Geralt', 'Cahir', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']
55222;The Tower of the Swallow;The traitors were supported by the Squirrels, rebellious elves â€“ and by Cahir, son of Ceallach.;['Squirrels', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
55223;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir had been sent to Thanedd on a special mission â€“ to capture and kidnap Ciri.;['Cahir', 'Thanedd'];['Cahir']
55224;The Tower of the Swallow;When Ciri defended herself, she wounded him â€“ the sight of the scar on Cahir's hand always leaves my mouth dry.;['Ciri', 'Cahir'];['Ciri', 'Cahir']
55229;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir is not talkative, but I have an ear for hints.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55231;The Tower of the Swallow;Since he is fluent in the common language, which is rare among Nilfgaardians, I think I know which branch of service Cahir was in and why he was promoted so quickly.;['Nilfgaardians', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
55234;The Tower of the Swallow;Because Cahir had already attempted to kidnap Ciri.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55237;The Tower of the Swallow;It was pure chance that I talked to Geralt about this.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
55244;The Tower of the Swallow;He looked at the Roach's mane.;['Roach'];['Roach']
55246;The Tower of the Swallow;They were not to allow Ciri to fall into Nilfgaardian hands.;['Ciri', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Ciri']
55247;The Tower of the Swallow;During the escape the knights were killed and Ciri was left alone in the midst of corpses and fires, in the narrow streets of a burning city.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
55250;The Tower of the Swallow;He, Cahir.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55256;The Tower of the Swallow;They rode in the rear â€“ Regis, Milva and Cahir were a good fifty paces ahead of them, but the poet did not want even one word of this conversation reaching the ears of the fellowship.;['Regis', 'Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']
55257;The Tower of the Swallow;'The problem is,' continued the witcher, 'that our Cahir was commanded to be noble.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55263;The Tower of the Swallow;What do you think, Dandelion?';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
55267;The Tower of the Swallow;Thanks to him, Ciri came away from Cintra unscathed.';['Ciri', 'Cintra'];['Ciri']
55270;The Tower of the Swallow;Stop trying to be so vindictive Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
55273;The Tower of the Swallow;He saved Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
55275;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt finally unlocked his gaze from Roach's mane, lifting his head.;['Geralt', 'Roach'];['Geralt', 'Roach']
55287;The Tower of the Swallow;Do you understand that, Dandelion?' 'Not particularly.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
55300;The Tower of the Swallow;I'll bet my head that no one in Nilfgaard even remembers Cahir anymore.;['Nilfgaard', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
55301;The Tower of the Swallow;*** Vattier de Rideaux, the chief of military intelligence for Nilfgaard, listened to the imperial reprimand with his head bowed.;['Vattier de Rideaux', 'Nilfgaard'];['Vattier']
55302;The Tower of the Swallow;'So that's it,' continued Emhyr var Emreis acidly.;['Emhyr var Emreis'];['Emhyr']
55306;The Tower of the Swallow;Believe me, Vattier, next time the Council discusses the need to cut the intelligence budget, I will have a sympathetic ear.;['Vattier', 'Council'];['Vattier']
55310;The Tower of the Swallow;Your Majesty can be sure that the traitor Cahir aep Ceallach will not escape his punishment.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55313;The Tower of the Swallow;And they are moderate, Vattier, moderate!;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55314;The Tower of the Swallow;What of the matter with Vilgefortz?;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55315;The Tower of the Swallow;Where the hell is Cirilla?;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
55329;The Tower of the Swallow;And when we finally find the real Cirilla, the wedded wife is simply... exchanged.';['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
55330;The Tower of the Swallow;'Have you gone mad, Vattier?';['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55332;The Tower of the Swallow;Cintra has not seen the real Cirilla in four years, and by the way it sounds, she spent more time on the Skellig Islands than in Cintra anyway.;['Cintra', 'Cirilla', 'four \r\nyears', 'the Skellig Islands', 'Cintra'];['Cirilla']
55334;The Tower of the Swallow;'No!' 'Your Imperial...' 'No, Vattier!;"[""'Your Imperial"", 'Vattier']";['Vattier']
55335;The Tower of the Swallow;I want the real Ciri!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
55340;The Tower of the Swallow;Because I'm sure wherever Vilgefortz is, Ciri is near.';['Vilgefortz', 'Ciri'];['Vilgefortz', 'Ciri']
55341;The Tower of the Swallow;'Your Imperial Majesty...' 'I'm listening Vattier!;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55343;The Tower of the Swallow;'In the past, I've suspected that the matter with Vilgefortz was an ordinary provocation.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55346;The Tower of the Swallow;'However... it is not public knowledge in Redania, but I know from my agent that Dijkstra has discovered one of the hideouts of Vilgefortz, and there is evidence that the magician has carried out brutal human experiments.;['Redania', 'Dijkstra', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55348;The Tower of the Swallow;So if Vilgefortz had Cirilla in his power, then I fear that the continued search for her...' 'Shut up, damn it!';['Vilgefortz', 'Shut'];['Vilgefortz']
55349;The Tower of the Swallow;'On the other hand,' Vattier de Rideaux hastily steered the conversation away, obeying the unspoken order in the Emperor's angry eyes, 'it could all be disinformation.;['Vattier de Rideaux'];['Vattier']
55352;The Tower of the Swallow;'You should remove him and find Vilgefortz and Ciri!;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55368;The Tower of the Swallow;'Are you sure that is not envy speaking, Vattier?;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55373;The Tower of the Swallow;Vattier de Rideaux was tired.;['Vattier de Rideaux'];['Vattier']
55389;The Tower of the Swallow;Emperor Torres had been prone to it and gifted it a golden commemorative medal, which was attached to the gill cover of the giant fish.;['Torres'];['Torres']
55390;The Tower of the Swallow;'Good evening, Viscount.' Vattier flicked his forearm, shaking loose the stiletto hidden in his sleeve.;['evening', 'Viscount', 'Vattier'];['Vattier']
55397;The Tower of the Swallow;Vattier put away the stiletto.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55402;The Tower of the Swallow;And against my master Vilgefortz?';['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55404;The Tower of the Swallow;'Hell, Vattier.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55405;The Tower of the Swallow;I assure you that we are still on your side, myself and Vilgefortz.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55406;The Tower of the Swallow;Well, I confess we have betrayed you, because we gave you the wrong Cirilla, but that was done in good faith, may I be drowned if I lie.;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
55407;The Tower of the Swallow;After the real one was gone, Vilgefortz figured wrong was better than none.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55415;The Tower of the Swallow;'I don't know you any more, Vattier.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55416;The Tower of the Swallow;The Vattier I knew, even if the devil had appeared before him, wouldn't fail to find out if it could be beneficial to him, accidently or not, before he performed the exorcism.';['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55417;The Tower of the Swallow;Vattier did not acknowledge the illusion by looking at it, but instead watched the algae-covered carp lazily stir up the mud in the pond.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55423;The Tower of the Swallow;Maybe your boss, Vilgefortz?;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55426;The Tower of the Swallow;The illusion of Rience raised his illusory hand.;['Rience'];['Rience']
55429;The Tower of the Swallow;We will procure the head of Cahir for you.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55430;The Tower of the Swallow;Myself and my master, Vilgefortz...' 'Mercy, Rience' snorted Vattier.;['Vilgefortz', 'Vattier'];['Vilgefortz', 'Vattier']
55432;The Tower of the Swallow;Vilgefortz â€“ with my humble help â€“ will procure for you the head of Cahir, son of Ceallach.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55440;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir, my dear Viscount, is...;['Cahir', 'Viscount'];['Cahir']
55444;The Tower of the Swallow;'The head' Vattier said smiling, 'which will no longer be able to tell what really happened on Thanedd.';['Vattier', 'Thanedd'];['Vattier']
55446;The Tower of the Swallow;'Why give Cahir the opportunity to give speeches?;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
55447;The Tower of the Swallow;Our job is to appease the animosity between Vilgefortz and the emperor, not to deepen it.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
55452;The Tower of the Swallow;The carp, thought Vattier, must be full of wisdom.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55457;The Tower of the Swallow;Where is Stefan Skellen and what are his plans?';['Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']
55459;The Tower of the Swallow;Vattier de Rideaux stretched out on the pillow while he played with a golden lock of Carthia van Canten's hair.;"['Vattier de Rideaux', ""Carthia van Canten's""]";['Vattier']
55466;The Tower of the Swallow;Carthia van Canten, nicknamed Cantarella, did not answer.;['Carthia van Canten', 'Cantarella'];['Carthia']
55467;The Tower of the Swallow;Vattier did not expect her to.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55469;The Tower of the Swallow;Her interests were limited to â€“ at least for now â€“ making love, with â€“ at least for now â€“ Vattier.;['Vattier'];['Vattier']
55474;The Tower of the Swallow;'In such a profession one expects a reprimand,' Vattier said bitterly 'because I have not found Cirilla.;['Vattier', 'Cirilla'];['Vattier', 'Cirilla']

55481;The Tower of the Swallow;It was a vintage that recalled the days when the Emperor was Emhyr var Emreis the little boy, deprived of his right to the throne and cruelly insulted â€“ and Vattier de Rideaux was the young intelligence officer, insignificant in the department's hierarchy.;['the days', 'Emhyr var Emreis', 'Vattier de Rideaux'];['Emhyr', 'Vattier']

55486;The Tower of the Swallow;'Stefan Skellen, my sweet,' murmured the chief of the imperial intelligence 'is a trickster and a conspirator.;['Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']

55494;The Tower of the Swallow;Carthia van Canten bestowed her talent to Vattier de Rideaux, chief of the imperial intelligence, slowly and skilfully.;['Carthia van Canten', 'Vattier de Rideaux'];['Carthia', 'Vattier']

55496;The Tower of the Swallow;But Vattier de Rideaux had no idea of that.;['Vattier de Rideaux'];['Vattier']
55497;The Tower of the Swallow;He did not know that, despite appearances, Carthia van Canten possessed an excellent memory and an intelligence like quicksilver.;['Carthia van Canten'];['Carthia']
55498;The Tower of the Swallow;Everything Vattier told her, every scrap of information, every word that he had uttered to her during their meeting â€“ Carthia repeated the following morning to the sorceress Assir var Anahid.;['Vattier', 'Carthia', 'Assir', 'Anahid'];['Vattier', 'Carthia']
55500;The Tower of the Swallow;Yes, I'll bet my head that no one in Nilfgaard even remembered Cahir, not even his fiancÃ©, if he had one.;['Nilfgaard', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']

57508;The Tower of the Swallow;'Are you,' said the sergeant commanding the troops, while he tapped an oak stick against his calf, 'the witcher named Geralt?';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57509;The Tower of the Swallow;'Yes,' Geralt replied after a moment's hesitation, 'I am.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57520;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt adjusted his sword belt rather pointedly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57545;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and faked indifference.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57554;The Tower of the Swallow;For what purpose?' Geralt did not look away â€“ he focused his scorching gaze on the governor's single eye.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57562;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt hesitated.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57574;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt did not reply immediately.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57592;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt did not interrupt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57595;The Tower of the Swallow;'But not all?' guessed Geralt without further ado, becoming a little bored with all the eloquence.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57619;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt calmed himself down with a couple of breaths, because all of the sudden he had a certain idea that caused heart palpitations and increased adrenaline.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57624;The Tower of the Swallow;Because the guards had just brought Ciri into the room.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
57625;The Tower of the Swallow;'Oh, look here,' said Ciri, immediately after being placed in the chair with her hands tied behind her back.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
57628;The Tower of the Swallow;One of the guards, a tall guy with the face of a not particularly bright lad, casually slapped Ciri so hard that the chair shook.;['One', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
57642;The Tower of the Swallow;'Reckless...' Geralt already saw that it was not Ciri, and could only wonder at his confusion.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']

57689;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt yelled quickly and sharply before they could strike her.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57725;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt said before they could beat her.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57747;The Tower of the Swallow;Her whole slender body seemed to point to Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57751;The Tower of the Swallow;Let him deny that he is Geralt the witcher!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57758;The Tower of the Swallow;Nothing but swindlers!' 'Do not beat her,' said Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57768;The Tower of the Swallow;'Take her away,' Fulk ordered and gestured for Geralt, who wanted to protest, to be silent.;"[""'Take"", 'Fulk', 'Geralt']";['Geralt']
57777;The Tower of the Swallow;'How?' 'Homer Straggen, called the Nightingale, is an exceedingly dangerous criminal.;['Homer Straggen', 'Nightingale'];['Homer']
57849;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt made no comment.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57868;The Tower of the Swallow;'I, Lord Fulk,' said Geralt calmly, 'even like the world you're envisioning and imagining.';['Fulk', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
57900;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt slightly raised an eyebrow.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57921;The Tower of the Swallow;I'll make an agreement with you, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57964;The Tower of the Swallow;'I'm not trying to' Geralt said slowly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57977;The Tower of the Swallow;The vampire rode side by side with Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
57980;The Tower of the Swallow;'We are five, not four,' he quickly summarized after Geralt had finished his story.;['five', 'four', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']

58008;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt smiled distastefully.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58012;The Tower of the Swallow;'I do not like what you are saying, Geralt,' he said finally.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58018;The Tower of the Swallow;Regis interrupted in a tone that Geralt had never heard from him before.;['Regis', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
58031;The Tower of the Swallow;Angouleme muttered something to herself, stopped spurring Draakula, and fell back, because Geralt and Regis increased their pace and overtook Dandelion, Milva, and Cahir, who rode ahead them.;['Angouleme', 'Draakula', 'Geralt', 'Regis', 'Milva', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Milva', 'Cahir']

58049;The Tower of the Swallow;'You have an incredible talent for simplifying, Dandelion,' muttered, Cahir.;['Dandelion', 'Cahir'];['Dandelion', 'Cahir']
58052;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt?' 'Let's start' â€“ the witcher threw a twig he had played for a long time into the fire -'with the fact that this is my plan and I do not need anyone's help.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58063;The Tower of the Swallow;'What the hell â€“ a Hanse?' 'Aen Hanse,' said Cahir, 'in our language, means an armed crew, but one that is held together by friendships...' 'A secret society?';['Hanse', 'Aen Hanse', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
58082;The Tower of the Swallow;'I, too,' Cahir said immediately.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58084;The Tower of the Swallow;Milva said fiercely.;['Milva'];['Milva']
58095;The Tower of the Swallow;he advised the witcher and Milva with flashing eyes.;['Milva'];['Milva']
58100;The Tower of the Swallow;'From that barge and bridge,' Milva replied flatly, 'you carried me out on your back when my legs were so weak that they buckled.;['Milva'];['Milva']
58107;The Tower of the Swallow;Milva's eyes sparkled threateningly.;['Milva'];['Milva']
58122;The Tower of the Swallow;Do you finally understand, Dandelion?';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
58143;The Tower of the Swallow;'Myself, Angouleme, and Milva,' he said, 'will ride to Belhaven.;['Myself', 'Angouleme', 'Milva', 'Belhaven'];['Milva']

58166;The Tower of the Swallow;If it proves necessary, you will obtain the information from the Druids and go on looking for Ciri... alone.';['Druids', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
58188;The Tower of the Swallow;'Why?' Geralt calmed Milva with a gesture.;['Geralt', 'Milva'];['Geralt', 'Milva']
58195;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt's fingers clasped the shoulder of the archer, who was furious.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58196;The Tower of the Swallow;'Milva, not Cahir.;['Milva', 'Cahir'];['Milva', 'Cahir']

58198;The Tower of the Swallow;'And why not?' Asked Angouleme and Cahir almost simultaneously.;['Asked Angouleme', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
58203;The Tower of the Swallow;'Explain that,' Cahir said.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58208;The Tower of the Swallow;'It seems to me' â€“ Cahir drew his eyebrows together -'that you are hinting that I am a traitor.';['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58213;The Tower of the Swallow;'Geralt,' said Dandelion.;['Geralt', 'Dandelion'];['Geralt', 'Dandelion']
58216;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir pursed his lips.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']

58230;The Tower of the Swallow;'So I was not wrong,' Cahir said slowly.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58232;The Tower of the Swallow;A vicious, duplicitous traitor?' 'Geralt,' Regis rejoined the discussion.;['Geralt', 'Regis'];['Geralt']
58235;The Tower of the Swallow;'I am a traitor,' repeated Cahir, as if he had not heard the vampire's words.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58239;The Tower of the Swallow;Yes?' 'Without pathos, Nilfgaardian,' growled Geralt, who stood before Cahir and fixed his eyes on him.;['Nilfgaardian', 'Geralt', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']
58253;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt did not completely succeeded with his dodge, and the gloved fist hit him on the cheek with such force that he fell right back into the fire, sending sparks flying.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58255;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir was already with him.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58258;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt spat a filthy curse and threw himself at Cahir, embracing him with his arms and throwing him to the ground, where they rolled in the gravel and crashed fists.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58260;The Tower of the Swallow;roared Dandelion.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
58262;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir struck Geralt, who was trying to get up, and knocked him off his feet again.;['Cahir', 'Geralt'];['Cahir', 'Geralt']
58264;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt turned over, pulled up, and kicked him in the hip.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58269;The Tower of the Swallow;The belt whistled and clapped as it met with hands, shoulders, back, or arms â€“ sometime's Cahir's, sometimes Geralt's.;['Cahir', 'Geralt'];['Cahir', 'Geralt']
58270;The Tower of the Swallow;When they parted, Milva jumped back and forth between them like a grasshopper, still continuing to whip them, one no more than the other.;['Milva', 'one'];['Milva']
58272;The Tower of the Swallow;She cried, and sent a blow crashing onto Geralt's back.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58276;The Tower of the Swallow;She shouted even louder, while Cahir covered his head with one of his hands.;['Cahir', 'one'];['Cahir']
58281;The Tower of the Swallow;'Enough,' agreed Cahir, curled up.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58284;The Tower of the Swallow;'It really is, Milva.';['Milva'];['Milva']
58288;The Tower of the Swallow;Milva turned on her heel and swung the belt with full force at her shoulder.;['Milva'];['Milva']
58300;The Tower of the Swallow;Beside him, Cahir raised himself off the ground, quite inelegantly.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58304;The Tower of the Swallow;Milva dropped the belt, knelt down, and after a brief moment of hesitation silently hugged herself.;['Milva'];['Milva']

58339;The Tower of the Swallow;Angouleme wrapped a woollen band around her forehead and stuck a hunting knife stuck in her boot â€“ a gift from Milva.;['Angouleme', 'Milva'];['Milva']
58346;The Tower of the Swallow;'Cahir, son of Ceallach' began Geralt, trying not to sound pathetic.;['Cahir', 'Geralt'];['Cahir', 'Geralt']
58351;The Tower of the Swallow;'I have omitted to Cahir and to you the reason for my anger, my rage, and my grief.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']

58362;The Tower of the Swallow;'Geralt may be right,' Regis said slowly.;['Geralt', 'Regis'];['Geralt']
58381;The Tower of the Swallow;Surely you haven't had a premonition as clearly as Cahir and I, but you can imagine, yes.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']

58414;The Tower of the Swallow;Vysogota raised his head.;['Vysogota'];['Vysogota']

58560;The Tower of the Swallow;If you just want to...' 'What?' 'I should go check on the horses,' Cahir said quickly, standing up and wrapping his coat around him.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
58579;The Tower of the Swallow;Angouleme dismounted and signalled for Geralt and Cahir to dismount as well.;['Angouleme', 'Geralt', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']
58587;The Tower of the Swallow;'Thanks for the lecture,' Geralt interrupted her with sour expression.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

58612;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt could imagine why.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
58613;The Tower of the Swallow;His face still shone and Cahir's was still covered in stains, bruises, scratches and scrapes â€“ the scenic remnants of the fight and the beating Milva had given them.;['Cahir', 'Milva'];['Cahir', 'Milva']
58625;The Tower of the Swallow;Don't ask silly questions, Golan.;['Golan'];['Golan']

59216;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt's horse, a bay stallion with a Nilfgaardian bridle, began to wheeze and gasp and had trouble even keeping its head up.;['Geralt', 'Nilfgaardian'];['Geralt']
59217;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir's horse, also from the military, was stronger and more enduring, but that made no difference because its rider was troubled.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
59237;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir's horse was in slightly better condition, but Cahir was in even worse.;['Cahir', 'Cahir'];['Cahir', 'Cahir']
59240;The Tower of the Swallow;When Geralt and Angouleme tried to touch his bloody head, he cried out.;['Geralt', 'Angouleme'];['Geralt']

59297;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt couldn't make out whether Nightingale himself participated in the pursuit, or whether he had cleaned and bandaged his slashed face.;['Geralt', 'Nightingale'];['Geralt']
59298;The Tower of the Swallow;As the sound of hooves faded into the distance, Geralt got out of his hiding place in the bracken, lifted the moaning and groaning Cahir, and held him steady.;['Geralt', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']

59310;The Tower of the Swallow;After a while Cahir could go no further â€“ he no longer obediently put one foot in front of the other, he no longer moved, the witcher had to drag him.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
59312;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt groaned and carried the wounded man on his back.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

59350;The Tower of the Swallow;Both Cahir and he were tormented by thirst.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
59351;The Tower of the Swallow;'Geralt?' 'Yes.' Cahir straightened the logs in the fire with the help of a leg bone he had found.;['Geralt', 'Cahir'];['Geralt', 'Cahir']

59399;The Tower of the Swallow;'That's okay, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

59420;The Tower of the Swallow;But a girl?' Geralt threw the backbone of a trout into their camp fire.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59423;The Tower of the Swallow;He listened to Cahir's story, his curiosity struggling against a deep sense of regret.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
59424;The Tower of the Swallow;'All in all, it was a coincidence,' said Cahir while gazing into the fire.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
59429;The Tower of the Swallow;My group randomly encountered Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
59441;The Tower of the Swallow;I saw the sword protrude an inch from Ciri's head, and she fell again to the ground.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
59449;The Tower of the Swallow;Ciri began creeping into the puddles of water and blood, but they had already begun to steam strongly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

59550;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt did not answer.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59551;The Tower of the Swallow;Cahir did not repeat the question.;['Cahir'];['Cahir']
59567;The Tower of the Swallow;*** Not long ago, Geralt would have mercilessly ridiculed, mocked, and held for an idiot anyone who dared to claim that he, a witcher, would feel great joy at the sight of a vampire.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59580;The Tower of the Swallow;They're safe,' confirmed the vampire, spurring his mule, Draakul.;['Draakul'];['Draakul']
59585;The Tower of the Swallow;'Stick to the topic, Regis,' Geralt interrupted. 'Of course, I'm sorry.;['Stick', 'Regis', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']

59673;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt spat towards the waterfall and the cave.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59683;The Tower of the Swallow;'Under no circumstances, Geralt of Rivia.';['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']

59778;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt had no idea what it was.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59780;The Tower of the Swallow;'Witcher!' articulated the thing, which was clearly not a Pekingese, tightly clinging to Geralt's boot.;['Pekingese', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
59787;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt did not know what it was.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59815;The Tower of the Swallow;That bastard is distilling his own moonshine here, Geralt thought mechanically.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59838;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt spat out blood from his cut lip.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
59872;The Tower of the Swallow;Geralt looked at him in silence.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

60087;The Tower of the Swallow;growled Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

67361;The Lady of the Lake;Condwiramurs admired her figure.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67364;The Lady of the Lake;Condwiramurs was only twenty-four and she envied her.;['Condwiramurs', 'only twenty-four'];['Condwiramurs']
67367;The Lady of the Lake;'Let's halt this discussion for a while,' cut off Nimue.;['Nimue'];['Nimue']
67376;The Lady of the Lake;Condwiramurs considered this behaviour offensive and reprehensible.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67379;The Lady of the Lake;So if it was true that in her early days on Inis Vitre, Condwiramurs was somewhat astonished by the inclinations of Nimue, they had now stopped.;['Condwiramurs', 'Nimue'];['Condwiramurs', 'Nimue']
67382;The Lady of the Lake;Nevertheless, thought Condwiramurs, it is an unforgivable insult and an affront turning towards this rods and bait when there were two women parading naked, with bodies worthy of nymphs, from which the eyes should not be able to break away.;['Condwiramurs', 'two'];['Condwiramurs']
67385;The Lady of the Lake;I know all of Reverend Jarre's, various scientific treatises on the popular editions that I will not even mention.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
67390;The Lady of the Lake;'The same as,' Nimue nodded towards the boat on the lake, 'which the Fisher King has.;['Nimue', 'the Fisher King'];['Nimue']
67394;The Lady of the Lake;'So happy fishing then,' Condwiramurs sighed and began to dress.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67398;The Lady of the Lake;With all due respect, Nimue, but we are not the first in this fishery.;['Nimue', 'first'];['Nimue']
67401;The Lady of the Lake;'They left,' Nimue said with conviction, combing her hair, 'Blank spaces filled with rhetoric and fabrications.;['Nimue', 'Blank'];['Nimue']
67417;The Lady of the Lake;Nimue smiled.;['Nimue'];['Nimue']
67425;The Lady of the Lake;'Yes,' Geralt confirmed dryly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
67446;The Lady of the Lake;'Return to Caed Myrkvid, to see Cahir, who no doubt has had his scalp wound healed by the Druids.;['Caed Myrkvid', 'Cahir', 'Druids'];['Cahir']

67454;The Lady of the Lake;'You can count on me,' Geralt said seriously.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

67472;The Lady of the Lake;Again Condwiramurs ate too much.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67473;The Lady of the Lake;***  Condwiramurs belched.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67494;The Lady of the Lake;After twelve nights on the island, Condwiramurs already had three lists of dreams.;['twelve nights', 'Condwiramurs', 'three'];['Condwiramurs']
67497;The Lady of the Lake;There was also a list that Nimue had recognised as a list of failures, dreams that despite all their efforts remained an enigma.;['Nimue'];['Nimue']
67501;The Lady of the Lake;Well, thought Condwiramurs, closing her eyes.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67507;The Lady of the Lake;'Of course' Condwiramurs said boastfully, 'I dreamed!;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67523;The Lady of the Lake;*** 'Tell me, Geralt, do you believe in love at first sight?';['Geralt', 'first'];['Geralt']

67596;The Lady of the Lake;Before lunch, Condwiramurs went for a walk, but walks soon became boring.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67603;The Lady of the Lake;Instead of dreams of the enigma of the legend of the withcer, Condwiramurs dreamed of the Fisher King in a variety of situations from the non-erotic to the extremely erotic.;['Condwiramurs', 'Fisher King'];['Condwiramurs', 'Fisher']
67604;The Lady of the Lake;In the extremely non-erotic dreams the Fisher King dragged her behind the boat tied to a rope.;['Fisher King'];['Fisher']
67606;The Lady of the Lake;When it seemed the something was about to catch her, the Fisher King pulled powerfully on the oars, the rope tighten and she was pulled away from the jaws of the unseen predator.;['Fisher King'];['Fisher']
67609;The Lady of the Lake;Apart from the physical pleasure, Condwiramurs felt an apprehension that chilled her bowels: what if Nimue caught them?;['Condwiramurs', 'Nimue'];['Condwiramurs', 'Nimue']
67616;The Lady of the Lake;At first Condwiramurs paid it no attention, but over time she had reason to ponder.;['first', 'Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67619;The Lady of the Lake;Aware that the home of the sorceress cannot go with such a secret anomaly, Condwiramurs did not ask questions.;['Aware', 'anomaly', 'Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']
67625;The Lady of the Lake;The author was apparently fascinated by the adventures of Ciri and the Tower of the Swallow, because all of her works had been devoted to them.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
67629;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri and a tower...;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
67632;The Lady of the Lake;Nothing except the visual experience?' Nimue, of course, knew that as a capable dreamer, like Condwiramurs used all her senses, she doesn't just receive the dream through her eyes like most people, but also through hearing, touch, smell â€“ and even taste.;['Nimue', 'Condwiramurs'];['Nimue', 'Condwiramurs']
67638;The Lady of the Lake;As Condwiramurs had guessed, access to the balcony was only possible going through the private chambers of the sorceress.;['Condwiramurs'];['Condwiramurs']

67669;The Lady of the Lake;'It is a mirror of Hartmann,' Nimue said, seeing the adept's wrinkled nose and angry gesture.;['Hartmann', 'Nimue'];['Nimue']

67703;The Lady of the Lake;'It is with great regret I must inform you,' said Vilgefortz, his fingers caressing the stem of his cup, 'that Ciri, your ward, has departed from this world.;['Vilgefortz', 'Ciri'];['Vilgefortz', 'Ciri']
67704;The Lady of the Lake;You can only blame yourself, Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
67708;The Lady of the Lake;'To your health,' Yennefer said, not upset at all by Vilgefortz angry words.;['Yennefer', 'Vilgefortz'];['Yennefer', 'Vilgefortz']

67723;The Lady of the Lake;'Good,' Yennefer, barely keeping the knife in your fingers, clumsily cut into her second course of stuffed pork chop.;['Yennefer', 'second'];['Yennefer']
67724;The Lady of the Lake;'On the contrary,' continued the sorcerer, 'to you Ciri was only a silly sentiment, consisting of equal parts of the penalty of your infertility and your guilt.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
67725;The Lady of the Lake;Yes, yes, Yennefer, a sentiment of guilt!;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
67726;The Lady of the Lake;After you had actively participated in genetic experiments, by which Ciri came into the world.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
67728;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer saluted him in silence, praying that the cup would not slip from her fingers.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
67731;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz snorted at her gesture.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
67732;The Lady of the Lake;'It's too late,' he said through gritted teeth, 'you have to know, Yennefer, I have enough knowledge.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
67736;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer snorted dismissively, although inside she was boiling with rage.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
67738;The Lady of the Lake;'Because I have the sad news that the witcher, Geralt of Rivia is also dead.;['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']

67740;The Lady of the Lake;Know Yennefer that our dear friend, the witcher, said goodbye to the world in a truly fiery spectacular.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

67789;The Lady of the Lake;As usual, when being led from cell to cell, Yennefer tried to figure out when she was, to get some scrap of information that could help her plan her escape.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
67793;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer remembered, however, how happy she was when they had moved her here from the dungeon.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

68558;The Lady of the Lake;'I recognise that I did not get any concrete information from the druids or any clues, albeit only the most vague, to explain why Ciri had become the object of such fierce persecution.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
68567;The Lady of the Lake;Anna Henrietta sighed again and took the handkerchief from Dandelion again.;['Anna Henrietta'];['Anna']

68578;The Lady of the Lake;'I thank you for your kindness and grace,' Geralt bowed.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68580;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri is still in danger.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
68584;The Lady of the Lake;The Duchess was silent for a while, stroking Dandelion's forearm with a rhythmic movement, like a cat.;['The Duchess', 'Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
68590;The Lady of the Lake;'I appreciate that,' Geralt swept another bow, and cursed his sore knee in spirit, and not just his knee.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68599;The Lady of the Lake;I wrote of this matter to my cousin Emhyr var Emreis.;['Emhyr var Emreis'];['Emhyr']
68602;The Lady of the Lake;'Not so,' Geralt said calmly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

68633;The Lady of the Lake;Anarietta took the handkerchief and touch the tip of her nose with it and smiled at Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68641;The Lady of the Lake;'We would also like to ask you something, Mister Geralt,' Anarietta interrupted the silence.;['Geralt', 'Anarietta'];['Geralt']

68689;The Lady of the Lake;'A solpuga,' said Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68705;The Lady of the Lake;'They are expensive,' Geralt finished for him, but not particularly scathing.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68714;The Lady of the Lake;'I too am surprised,' Geralt admitted frankly.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68721;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt cursed under his breath.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68727;The Lady of the Lake;'Allow me, gentlemen,' said the man with the bull's head shield, 'to introduce, Baron Palmerin de Launfal.;['Baron', 'Palmerin de Launfal'];['Baron', 'Palmerin']

68763;The Lady of the Lake;'The ladies of Toussaint,' Geralt said looking around, 'would not be very happy if they knew of this conversation.;['Toussaint', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']

68767;The Lady of the Lake;'Open an account for me with one of the local dwarven banks,' Geralt said slowly and quietly.;['one', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
68775;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt looked somewhere high above the tops of the cypress trees.;['Geralt', 'cypress'];['Geralt']
68778;The Lady of the Lake;Given Milva's broken ribs, it may even be more than a few days.;['Milva', 'more than a few days'];['Milva']

68790;The Lady of the Lake;'The large and highly anticipated banquet,' Geralt said, 'was prepared with great care and diligence.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

68821;The Lady of the Lake;'You will not regret it, neither you nor the aunt,' Geralt assured him with a straight face.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68832;The Lady of the Lake;'Nothing, nothing,' Geralt smiled.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68845;The Lady of the Lake;'Let's go, Reynart.;['Reynart'];['Reynart']
68884;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt took a platter covered in a perch and parsley and offered it to Fringilla Vigo who was sitting to his left.;['Geralt', 'Fringilla Vigo'];['Geralt', 'Fringilla']
68887;The Lady of the Lake;'Your health, Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68904;The Lady of the Lake;Cahir and Milva sat on the opposite side of the table.;['Cahir', 'Milva'];['Cahir', 'Milva']
68913;The Lady of the Lake;'These knives,' explained Fringilla, 'have been used in Beauclair since the days of Princess Caroline Roberta, Anna Henrietta's grandmother.;"['Fringilla', 'Beauclair', 'the days', 'Caroline Roberta', ""Anna Henrietta's""]";['Fringilla']
68917;The Lady of the Lake;She pretended to put the fork in her mouth, but a menacing glare from Geralt stopped her.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68919;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt took a pot of duck in aspic and served it to Fringilla.;['Geralt', 'Fringilla'];['Geralt', 'Fringilla']
68920;The Lady of the Lake;He saw two young Baronesses religiously looking at Cahir, and how he honestly tried to divide among them equally his attention.;['two', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
68922;The Lady of the Lake;He saw Milva crumbling bread and staring at the tablecloth.;['Milva'];['Milva']
68923;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla seemed to read his thoughts.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
68927;The Lady of the Lake;'Maybe it's better,' Geralt said quietly, 'a slobbery and willing courtier would have been worse.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68928;The Lady of the Lake;I know Milva.';['Milva'];['Milva']
68963;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt hoped Fringilla would not pursue the subject.;['Geralt', 'Fringilla'];['Geralt', 'Fringilla']
68968;The Lady of the Lake;Oh, Geralt!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
68998;The Lady of the Lake;'It's a deer,' Geralt said.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69001;The Lady of the Lake;'And not just any deer,' Milva spoke, clearing her throat.;['Milva'];['Milva']
69008;The Lady of the Lake;But Geralt took to heart, Fringilla's words.;['Geralt', 'Fringilla'];['Geralt', 'Fringilla']
69009;The Lady of the Lake;'Were you perhaps, Lord Baron,' he asked, 'the happy hunter, who took down this beast?' 'No,' he replied.;['Baron'];['Baron']
69013;The Lady of the Lake;Milva asked, still staring at the tablecloth.;['Milva'];['Milva']
69015;The Lady of the Lake;'The double bent zefar,' the Baron said slowly, visibly surprised.;['Baron'];['Baron']
69018;The Lady of the Lake;'And tension?' 'Twenty-nice inches,' the Baron spoke more slowly, he seemed to almost spit out the words.;['Twenty-nice inches', 'Baron'];['Baron']
69019;The Lady of the Lake;'A nice piece,' Milva said happily.;['Milva'];['Milva']
69022;The Lady of the Lake;'I,' growled the Baron somewhat indignantly, 'at a quarter of a hundred paces, hit a pheasant.';['Baron', 'a quarter of a hundred'];['Baron']
69023;The Lady of the Lake;'At a quarter of a hundred paces,' Milva lifted her head, 'I hit a squirrel.';['a quarter', 'Milva'];['Milva']

69027;The Lady of the Lake;To me the best...' 'To the health of Her Excellency Anna Henrietta!;['Anna Henrietta'];['Anna']
69031;The Lady of the Lake;The Baronesses whose names were Queline and Nique, listened to Cahir with open mouths, wide eyes and burning cheeks.;['Queline', 'Nique', 'Cahir'];['Cahir']
69033;The Lady of the Lake;For Geralt â€“ even with his witcher hearing â€“ could only make out a few buzz words here and there, but they seemed to be talking about ghosts, strigas, succubi and vampires.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69044;The Lady of the Lake;'Don't leave here so quickly,' Fringilla Vigo said suddenly, sipping from a cup.;['Fringilla Vigo'];['Fringilla']
69076;The Lady of the Lake;'A pity,' Fringilla squinted.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69079;The Lady of the Lake;So I'll tell you â€“ Fulko Artevelde, the prefect of Riebrune, thinks you are dead, some fugitives told him that the druids burned you alive.;['Fulko Artevelde', 'Riebrune'];['Fulko']
69080;The Lady of the Lake;Fulko is doing his best to cover up the matter.;['Fulko'];['Fulko']
69081;The Lady of the Lake;If the case came to light, it could trigger an investigation that could cost Fulko his career at best.;['Fulko'];['Fulko']
69103;The Lady of the Lake;The pockmarked and flushed baron, mesmerized by discussions about archery and hunting, even started flirting with Milva.;['Milva'];['Milva']
69109;The Lady of the Lake;'But we will not be staying here long,' Milva looked pleadingly at Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69111;The Lady of the Lake;But when she saw how disappointed the Baron looked, she hastily added, 'Under other circumstances, I would be happy to go hunting boars.';['Baron'];['Baron']
69112;The Lady of the Lake;The Baron immediately cheered up.;['Baron'];['Baron']
69116;The Lady of the Lake;Milva looked down at the tablecloth.;['Milva'];['Milva']
69117;The Lady of the Lake;The Baron grabbed a tray of fowl and served her then filled her cup.;['Baron'];['Baron']
69123;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla found Geralt's hand under the table and held it tightly.;['Fringilla', 'Geralt'];['Fringilla', 'Geralt']
69124;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt looked into her eyes.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69132;The Lady of the Lake;'You'll have to go to Beauclair alone,' Reynart de Bois-Fresnes said soon after they left the tavern.;['Beauclair', 'Reynart de Bois-Fresnes'];['Reynart']

69138;The Lady of the Lake;'Good night, Reynart.;['Reynart'];['Reynart']
69145;The Lady of the Lake;Roach's horseshoes rang against the pavement.;['Roach'];['Roach']
69146;The Lady of the Lake;Roach, thought the witcher as he headed towards the palace of Beauclair, a graceful grey mare, a gift from Anna Henrietta.;['Roach', 'Beauclair', 'Anna Henrietta'];['Roach', 'Anna']

69157;The Lady of the Lake;With everyone bowing to him!' Geralt was willing to believe that the girl was right.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69162;The Lady of the Lake;Anna Henrietta was thankfully not in sight, so Geralt unhesitatingly violated etiquette and headed straight for him friend.;['Anna Henrietta', 'Geralt'];['Anna', 'Geralt']
69167;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt said without exaggeration, 'this is the chase, huh?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69175;The Lady of the Lake;For me, Cahir and Angouleme.;['Cahir', 'Angouleme'];['Cahir']
69191;The Lady of the Lake;'I you like,' Geralt said without thinking, 'you can stay.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69201;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt remained silent.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69203;The Lady of the Lake;'For you, I'll prepare a thoroughbred mare named Roach, of course.;['Roach'];['Roach']
69221;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt was silent again, contemplating the titan's battle against the dragon.;['Geralt', 'titan'];['Geralt']
69233;The Lady of the Lake;'Have you ever heard a saying,' said Geralt, 'that princesses leap after love like hares?;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69235;The Lady of the Lake;'First of all,' snapped Dandelion, 'Even such an ignoramus like you should have heard of morganatic marriages.;['First', 'Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
69239;The Lady of the Lake;'I'm listening to you,' Geralt cut him off again, 'and I don't believe my own ears.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69255;The Lady of the Lake;'I realise that you have gone completely mad, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
69261;The Lady of the Lake;But I, Geralt, I did not say a word of complaint.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69272;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt was silent as long as Dandelion had been before.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69277;The Lady of the Lake;Farewell, Dandelion.';['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
69278;The Lady of the Lake;'Farewell, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']

69288;The Lady of the Lake;'Here, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69305;The Lady of the Lake;'This is a mess,' Fringilla made a sweeping gesture around her, 'is going to make my job easier.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69321;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla listened, sitting with her legs crossed on the pile of books.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69333;The Lady of the Lake;'With love,' Fringilla said, 'it is like nervous cramps.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69356;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt stuck his nose into Fringilla's neckline.;['Geralt', 'Fringilla'];['Geralt', 'Fringilla']
69377;The Lady of the Lake;Seeing that it was time, Fringilla eagerly spread her legs, bringing down books and pamphlets stacked in piles, which poured over them like an avalanche.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69378;The Lady of the Lake;A heavy, leather bound copy of Mortgage Law painfully struck her in the ribs and the Codex Diphmaticus, adorned with brass fittings, fell on Geralt's wrist.;['the Codex Diphmaticus', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
69379;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt assessed and took advantage of the situation â€“ placing the large tome where it was necessary.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69383;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt, who held her by the hips, unwittingly knocked over another pile of books, he was too preoccupied to worry about the pages that rained down on them.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69384;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla moaned uncontrollably, her head buried into the book Reflections on Inevitable Death.;['Fringilla', 'Reflections on Inevitable \r\nDeath'];['Fringilla']
69385;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla moaned again.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69389;The Lady of the Lake;At the level of Fringilla's waist lay Breeding Animals, in close proximity to her lovely breasts was a hard critical publication about useless and corrupt civil servants, and below that an economic study called Economics and Science â€“ How to create, distribute and consume wealth.;['Fringilla', 'Breeding Animals', 'Economics and Science'];['Fringilla']
69393;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla leaned back and cried out, hitting with her heel a pile of books.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69394;The Lady of the Lake;A copy of Reflections and Meditations for Every Day of the Year, an anonymous and interesting work, somehow appeared on Geralt's back.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69395;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt read over her shoulder, finding out whether he wanted to or not, notes that had been written by a doctor named Albertus Rivus, in a book called Academia Cintensis, printed by the master typographer Johann Froben Junior in the second year of the reign of His Majesty King Corbertt.;['Geralt', 'Albertus Rivus', 'Academia Cintensis', 'Johann Froben Junior', 'the second year'];['Geralt']
69397;The Lady of the Lake;What should I do, Fringilla wondered, lightly touching the hard edges of Geralt's side and a copy of the Reflections on the Nature of Things.;['Fringilla', 'Geralt'];['Fringilla', 'Geralt']
69404;The Lady of the Lake;*** We found a bed, Geralt remembered, he rode straight into an alley and with a kick spurred into a gallop.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69411;The Lady of the Lake;With a strong kick, he forced Roach into a gallop directly towards a clump of roses covered by snow and forced her to jump.;['Roach', 'gallop'];['Roach']
69418;The Lady of the Lake;Roach's horseshoes clattered on the palace courtyard of Beauclair.;['Roach', 'Beauclair'];['Roach']
69430;The Lady of the Lake;I wondered about Dandelion, I wondered about Geralt, but now it makes me kind of dizzy to be here and I feel a strange tingling...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69434;The Lady of the Lake;'We must talk to Geralt,' muttered Milva.;['Geralt', 'Milva'];['Geralt', 'Milva']
69436;The Lady of the Lake;'Yes, talk to him,' Cahir said sarcastically, 'in one of those rare moments, where he is available.;['Cahir', 'one'];['Cahir']

69455;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt carefully moved away.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
69466;The Lady of the Lake;But Fringilla was not asleep.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69486;The Lady of the Lake;Most knowledgeable of them all was Master of the Arcane, Artorios Vigo, a respected specialist in all kinds of illusion, whose young niece, Fringilla inherited her uncle's talent and also became a witch.;['Arcane', 'Artorios', 'Vigo', 'Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69487;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla stopped in front of a bare wall between two columns decorated with a floral motif.;['Fringilla', 'two'];['Fringilla']
69492;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla entered and without wasting time, started the tele-communicator.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']

69501;The Lady of the Lake;'This is bad,' said Philippa.;['Philippa'];['Philippa']
69505;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla was silent for a moment.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']

69538;The Lady of the Lake;Fringilla cleared her throat.;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
69541;The Lady of the Lake;The witcher calmed down to the point where Ciri's name no longer showed up in every conversation.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

70929;The Lady of the Lake;'And who told you,' Ciri frowned, 'that I have any intention of talking to you?;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
70948;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri stammered, her heels digging into the wet gravel.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71007;The Lady of the Lake;'Much you have strayed away,' he said quietly, 'from Lara Dorren.;['Lara Dorren'];['Lara']
71042;The Lady of the Lake;'I am the daughter of Pavetta!;['Pavetta'];['Pavetta']

71084;The Lady of the Lake;'I will seriously reiterate that we want you to bear a son, Swallow, daughter of Lara Dorren.;['Swallow', 'Lara Dorren'];['Lara']
71089;The Lady of the Lake;'My answer is no,' Ciri replied flatly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71099;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri also noticed that the other elves were watching.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71104;The Lady of the Lake;Your father, Cregennan, took our child.;['Cregennan'];['Cregennan']

71168;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri sighed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71176;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri noticed with astonishment that Avallac'h and his elves had started to softly chant some strange, monotonous melody.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71201;The Lady of the Lake;The sight of them reminded Ciri of the stone in Ellander, where Yennefer had taught her magic.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
71205;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri looked in the direction that the woman was pointing.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71210;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h shouted a few words.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"

71236;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h also dismounted and motioned for Ciri and the others to do the same.;"[""Avallac'h"", 'Ciri']";"[""Avallac'h"", 'Ciri']"
71238;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri eyed her companions.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71247;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri replied with a clumsy bow.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71248;The Lady of the Lake;'How did you know,' asked Avallac'h, 'that something threatened us?';"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71249;The Lady of the Lake;'I didn't know,' the elf looked at Ciri intently.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71254;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h did not confirm or deny.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"

71265;The Lady of the Lake;'I assume,' Eredin continued, 'that you have made a mistake.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71267;The Lady of the Lake;In this creation, deeply hidden, lies Lara's gene.;['Lara'];['Lara']
71269;The Lady of the Lake;Indeed, in her eyes I find something that awakens in me the memory of Lara Dorren.;['Lara Dorren'];['Lara']
71273;The Lady of the Lake;But Ciri noticed a shadow of a blush on his pale face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71278;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri's eyes flashed angrily.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71280;The Lady of the Lake;'You talk,' he said slowly, 'just like a human, Eredin.';['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71282;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri had seen such teeth â€“ very white, very small, inhuman, all identical and with no canines.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71285;The Lady of the Lake;But when Sparks smiled it looked nice, when Eredin did it, it looked ghastly.;['Sparks', 'Eredin'];['Eredin']
71299;The Lady of the Lake;'Eternity,' Eredin said soberly, but his strange green eyes flashed.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71311;The Lady of the Lake;He sniffed it and the handed it to Ciri with a bow.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71320;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri moved the myrtle closer to her face, so that Avallac'h would not noticed the excitement and fascination that enveloped her.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71327;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h played on his flute a variety of lively tunes.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71341;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h said calmly and factually, 'will be Auberon Muircetach.;"[""Avallac'h"", 'Auberon Muircetach']";"[""Avallac'h"", 'Auberon']"
71347;The Lady of the Lake;And Auberon Muircetach is, of course, our king.';['Auberon Muircetach'];['Auberon']
71363;The Lady of the Lake;Through the branches of the weeping willows that hung down over the river, flowing like green curtains, Ciri saw a palace.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71366;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri expected that at any moment the wind would blow and the palaces would disappear along with the rising river mist.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71369;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri looked raptly at the wispy hanging terraces and balconies, the bridges over the river which were hung with festoons of ivy, the stairs, balustrades, the arcades and cloisters, the columns, the domes, and the slender asparagus-like towers.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71372;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri's heart pounded and her throat was tight as she a passed fountains, mosaics and sculptures.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71381;The Lady of the Lake;*** They crossed the river by a bridge, the arch looked so frail that Kelpie rebelled and snorted when she tried to cross.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
71382;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri was tense and restless, but carefully looked around, not wanting to miss anything, none of the views, that the city of Tir Na Lia had to offer.;['Ciri', 'Tir Na Lia'];['Ciri']
71389;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri watched him in some surprise.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71390;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h, Eredin and all the elves that she had met so far were extremely tall, so that to look them in the eye she had to bend back her head.;"[""Avallac'h"", 'Eredin']";"[""Avallac'h"", 'Eredin']"

71400;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h by contrast, did not care at all.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71403;The Lady of the Lake;'Auberon,' he said briefly, 'is expecting us?' Eredin smiled.;['Auberon', 'Eredin'];['Auberon', 'Eredin']
71408;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h frowned.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71409;The Lady of the Lake;'Zireael,' Eredin explained, 'should appear before the king, unhurried, without pressure, relaxed, calm and in good spirits.;['Zireael', 'Eredin'];['Eredin']

71417;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h did not say anything.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71418;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri, of course, said nothing as well.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71419;The Lady of the Lake;'I'm not surprised,' Eredin continued.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71424;The Lady of the Lake;The look Ciri throw his way clearly said that would have to be proven to be believed.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71425;The Lady of the Lake;'Even if by some miracle, you collapse the barrier,' Eredin was not distracted by her look, 'you know that it would mean your doom.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71433;The Lady of the Lake;But it puzzled her that Avallac'h suddenly scowled and frowned, clearly unhappy with Eredin's speech.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71434;The Lady of the Lake;As if Eredin had said too much.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71469;The Lady of the Lake;Although she had learned that among the elves nobody looked like how she used to believe, Ciri was shocked.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71470;The Lady of the Lake;Every time they had spoken of a king, she had imagined someone like Ervyll of Verden, who she had been very close to becoming his daughter on one occasion.;['Ervyll', 'one'];['Ervyll']
71479;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri coughed softly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71481;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri could not help but sigh.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71487;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri stood silently not knowing what to say.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71488;The Lady of the Lake;Auberon Muircetach blew into the straw again, and launched another bubble into the air.;['Auberon Muircetach'];['Auberon']
71510;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri sighed again 'So you are in a hurry to return to your world,' said King Auberon Muiretach.;['Ciri', 'King Auberon Muiretach'];['Ciri']
71520;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri remained silent, biting her lip.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71530;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri was intrigues, but remained silent, aware that the elf was teasing.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71532;The Lady of the Lake;Auberon Muircetach smiled.;['Auberon Muircetach'];['Auberon']
71543;The Lady of the Lake;Under his burning gaze, Ciri nodded and licked her lips.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71559;The Lady of the Lake;He extended his hand and Ciri inadvertently clenched her teeth.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71560;The Lady of the Lake;But Auberon only touched her forearm and then her hands.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
71567;The Lady of the Lake;Lara's eyes.';['Lara'];['Lara']
71568;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri looked down.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71580;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h said a few quiet words to the elf and kissed her hand.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71582;The Lady of the Lake;Only once did she glance at Ciri and her eyes show exactly what she thought of her.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71585;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri watched anxiously., but the boat slid perfectly into the middle of the river, without deviating an inch.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71586;The Lady of the Lake;The boat was very strange, Ciri had never seen anything like it, even in Skellige where one could see everything that could move through water.;['Ciri', 'Skellige'];['Ciri']
71589;The Lady of the Lake;Avallac'h stopped playing.;"[""Avallac'h""]";"[""Avallac'h""]"
71591;The Lady of the Lake;He listened to Ciri's story with a vague smile.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71597;The Lady of the Lake;'Auberon treated you with reverence, as a native Aen Elle.;['Auberon', 'Aen Elle'];['Auberon']
71610;The Lady of the Lake;You do have some elementary education, so you must have heard of the Aen Ithlinnespeath â€“ the Ithlinne's Prophecy.;['the Aen Ithlinnespeath', 'Ithlinne'];['Ithlinne']
71617;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri did not interrupt him, afraid that he would start playing the flute again.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71618;The Lady of the Lake;'The child, on which so much depends,' said Avallac'h as he played with his flute, 'will be a descendant of Lara Dorren and a carrier of the gene, a gene that was specially built by us, it may save the inhabitants of your world.;['Lara Dorren'];['Lara']
71619;The Lady of the Lake;We have reason to think that the descenadant pf Lara and your child, of course, will have abilities a thousand times more powerful than those we have, the Knowing ones.;['Lara', 'a thousand'];['Lara']
71622;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri had learned that in the Elder Speech such rhetorical figures, although seemingly questions, do not require an answer, but simply prohibit a response.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71631;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri couldn't contain herself.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71636;The Lady of the Lake;It is important that you return to Auberon and spend the night with him.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
71655;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri had never tried that kind of mushroom.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71662;The Lady of the Lake;'As I understand it,' Auberon said, offering her another kind of mushroom, greenish and smelling like apple pie, 'you are convinced that destiny binds you to this man, Geralt?';['Auberon', 'Geralt'];['Auberon', 'Geralt']
71665;The Lady of the Lake;He, that is, Geralt, is predestined for me, and I him.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']

71720;The Lady of the Lake;But the vehement look from Auberon forced her to reply.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
71725;The Lady of the Lake;Although Ciri was in a hurry to get it over with, it took her a long time to take off her clothes.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71731;The Lady of the Lake;Auberon realised and wordlessly, he pointed to the bed.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
71742;The Lady of the Lake;But it did not work because he was not at all like Mistle.;['Mistle'];['Mistle']
71756;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri's blood rushed to her face and forehead.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
71779;The Lady of the Lake;What if like Eredin, when he see me he see a gold nugget in a pile of manure?';['Eredin'];['Eredin']
71795;The Lady of the Lake;I'll repeat â€“ be patient with Auberon.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
71805;The Lady of the Lake;He went to leave, but Ciri blocked his way.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

71839;The Lady of the Lake;You're the daughter of Lara Dorren.;['Lara Dorren'];['Lara']
71840;The Lady of the Lake;You are the daughter of Cregennan, you are an inconsiderable, arrogant, narcissistic dh'oine, a representative example of a race that knows nothing, but that has to ruin and destroy everything, who can defile with a touch alone and befoul with a mere thought.;"['Cregennan', ""dh'oine""]";['Cregennan']
71862;The Lady of the Lake;When, as on the previous occasion, he rose from the bed and left without saying anything, Ciri took it calmly and resignedly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

72010;The Lady of the Lake;The stallion screamed a hoarsely welcome, shook his head and grinned at Kelpie with yellow teeth.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72011;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie, true to the principle that there are some issues that ventilate with the lords, not the servants, tries to put her teeth into the elf's thigh.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72012;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri held the reins tightly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72049;The Lady of the Lake;With a cry, the elf spurred the stallion, which took off like a hurricane, before Kelpie had even started, they had the advantage.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']

72468;The Lady of the Lake;Trust them, Ihuarraquax requested.;['Ihuarraquax'];['Ihuarraquax']
72472;The Lady of the Lake;They will not like it, Ciri thought, when I give them the condition, they do not even like the sound of the word.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72477;The Lady of the Lake;'Ihuarraquax will come with me.';['Ihuarraquax'];['Ihuarraquax']
72480;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri had long been prepared.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72485;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri got Kelpie from the stables.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72505;The Lady of the Lake;'Lara,' the King of the Alders shook his head and touched his neck as if the golden royal torc'h was choking him.;['Lara', 'the King of the Alders'];['Lara']
72515;The Lady of the Lake;'Zireael,' he said, 'Lod'hlaith, you are destined to be the Lady of the Lake, and mine as it turns out.' 'Va'esse deireadh aep eigean...' he said after a moment and Ciri in horror realised that his movements and words had begun to slow.;"['Zireael', 'Lake', ""Va'esse"", 'Ciri']";['Ciri']
72530;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri leaned forward.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72548;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri was counting bridges.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72554;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri dropped the pole and drew her sword.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72567;The Lady of the Lake;Eredin parried and struck out again, Ciri deflected the blow.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72584;The Lady of the Lake;Auberon is waiting.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
72599;The Lady of the Lake;'Why? Auberon is dead.;['Auberon'];['Auberon']
72609;The Lady of the Lake;In the light Ciri could see what she wanted to see.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72625;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri could simply throw him out of the boat, however, that was not enough and she was afraid that he would continue his pursuit.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72645;The Lady of the Lake;Everything in this world seems beautiful, but to strangers it means death, she silently repeated Eredin's words.;['Eredin'];['Eredin']
72650;The Lady of the Lake;While she thought, she heard a whinny from Kelpie and hear an intense mental signal from the unicorn.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72660;The Lady of the Lake;The unicorn led Ciri to one of the gorges.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72666;The Lady of the Lake;There was a flash and Ciri gasped.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72686;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri threw the skull.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72689;The Lady of the Lake;Ihuarraquax snorted, loudly, warningly.;['Ihuarraquax'];['Ihuarraquax']
72691;The Lady of the Lake;With a single jump she was in the saddle and spurred Kelpie to a gallop.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72697;The Lady of the Lake;'Forward, Kelpie!';['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72698;The Lady of the Lake;In the glow of the lightning, Ciri could see through her watering eyes willows and alders along the trails.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72701;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie neighed shrilly and ran so fast it looked like her hooves did not touch the ground.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72702;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri laid flat on the back of her neck.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72706;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie neighed wildly.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72715;The Lady of the Lake;Ihuarraquax neighed.;['Ihuarraquax'];['Ihuarraquax']
72716;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri received his signal.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72718;The Lady of the Lake;She adhered herself to Kelpie's neck.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72720;The Lady of the Lake;And other signal from the unicorn roughly broke into Ciri's mind.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72725;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri did not understand, but struggled too.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72735;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie snorted and puffed.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72737;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri could see Ihuarraquax.;['Ihuarraquax'];['Ihuarraquax']
72746;The Lady of the Lake;The Seven Goats.;['Seven'];['Seven']
72751;The Lady of the Lake;His tone was so clear that Ciri understood everything.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72763;The Lady of the Lake;The Dragon disappeared and after the Lady Winter and the Seven Goats.;['Seven'];['Seven']
72776;The Lady of the Lake;The blood of Lara Dorren, daughter of Shiadhal.;['Lara Dorren', 'Shiadhal'];['Lara']
72777;The Lady of the Lake;Ihuarraquax neighed again, prompting her to hurry.;['Ihuarraquax'];['Ihuarraquax']
72778;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie replied.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
72779;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri pulled on her gloves.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
72784;The Lady of the Lake;The majority of historians tend to award the process, conviction and execution of Joachim de Wett to the violent, cruel and tyrannical nature of Emperor Emhyr.;['Joachim de Wett', 'Emhyr'];['Joachim', 'Emhyr']
72811;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre looked to the sky, which, like every night for almost a week, you could see a golden and red comet that swept across the sky from west to east, dragging behind it a line of fire.;['Jarre', 'every night', 'almost a week'];['Jarre']
72818;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre stopped.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72825;The Lady of the Lake;Through the darkness Jarre caught a blurry glimpse of the ruins of a building, probably a mill or a shack.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72841;The Lady of the Lake;'You were right, Okultich,' replied the other.;['Okultich'];['Okultich']
72845;The Lady of the Lake;screamed Jarre with all the force in his lungs, hoping that someone would hear and come to his aid.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72851;The Lady of the Lake;'That too,' replied the other with a lisp, something in his voice caused Jarre to shudder.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72857;The Lady of the Lake;'I warn you,' shouted Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72867;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre could not flee.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72873;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre?;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72876;The Lady of the Lake;Do you remember me, Jarre?';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72877;The Lady of the Lake;'I... remember,' Jarre struggled with all of his strength against a powerful, ugly and so far completely unknown to him feeling.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72883;The Lady of the Lake;Isn't it, Jarre?';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72884;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre swallowed the mouthful of bacon, which the strange company had given to him, along with some roasted turnips.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72886;The Lady of the Lake;'What direction are you headed, Jarre?' 'To Vizima.';['Jarre', 'Vizima'];['Jarre']
72890;The Lady of the Lake;What do you say to that, Milton?;['Milton'];['Milton']
72891;The Lady of the Lake;You remember Milton, Jarre?';['Milton', 'Jarre'];['Milton', 'Jarre']
72892;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre did not remember.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72896;The Lady of the Lake;They had both attended the minor seminary in the temple, Melfi had regularly and severely beat Jarre and called him a bastard conceived of nettles, without a mother or father.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72899;The Lady of the Lake;And when he finished his studies, Jarre, with a recommendation of the temple found a job as the assistant town clerk, and the journeyman cooper bowed deeply to him and assured him of their friendship.;['Jarre', 'cooper'];['Jarre']
72903;The Lady of the Lake;Those there are Milton and Ograbek, sons of serfs, but have been removed from their obligations, you know...';['Milton', 'serfs'];['Milton']
72904;The Lady of the Lake;'I know,' Jarre looked at the two young, blond villagers who were as alike as brothers.;['Jarre', 'two'];['Jarre']
72910;The Lady of the Lake;'I know,' Jarre nodded again.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72912;The Lady of the Lake;It was inevitable against the threat of Nilfgaard...' 'Listen, Pike, to how he speaks,' said on husky, broad-shouldered lad, who first shouted at Jarre on the bridge.;['Nilfgaard', 'Pike', 'first', 'Jarre'];['Pike', 'Jarre']
72915;The Lady of the Lake;'Shut up, Klaproth,' snarled Pike, the oldest boy in the group, who already boasted narrow droopy moustache.;['Shut', 'Klaproth', 'Pike'];['Klaproth', 'Pike']
72922;The Lady of the Lake;'Jarre, is in fact not stupid.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72924;The Lady of the Lake;'I wonder,' Pike looked at Jarre thought the smoke from the fire, his eyes glistened like an actual pike in the light of the torch at the bow of a fishing boat, 'what a scholar is doing on the road on the way to Vizima?';['Jarre', 'Vizima'];['Jarre']
72925;The Lady of the Lake;'Like you,' said Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72930;The Lady of the Lake;'I'm going to enlist as a volunteer,' said Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72934;The Lady of the Lake;'Look, guys,' said Pike after he caught his breath, 'you can find a double temperament in some people seated in contradictions.;['Pike'];['Pike']
72935;The Lady of the Lake;Two natures.;['Two'];['Two']
72940;The Lady of the Lake;Neither did Jarre.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72941;The Lady of the Lake;'Such feelings of patriotic obligations,' said Pike, 'reliably reveal those who are weak in the head.;['Pike'];['Pike']
72944;The Lady of the Lake;'They are personal,' said Jarre, 'and I'm not going to be talking about them.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72946;The Lady of the Lake;'Pay close attention to what I say,' Pike said after a moment of silence.;['Pike'];['Pike']
72953;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre was surprised at his sudden audacity.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72955;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre, it was just for fun!;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72956;The Lady of the Lake;We were just joking, right, Pike?' 'Sure,' Pike yawned.;['Pike'];['Pike']
72963;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre was silent.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72969;The Lady of the Lake;"The night was very cold, despite his fatigue; Jarre could not sleep, curled up under his blanket, his knees almost touching his chin.";['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72972;The Lady of the Lake;In the first dream he saw the Witcher Geralt or Rivia who occasionally visited mother Nenneke.;['first', 'the Witcher Geralt or', 'Rivia', 'Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
72974;The Lady of the Lake;In the second dream, Ciri was hunched over a horse's neck, galloping towards a low wall of alders.;['second', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
72981;The Lady of the Lake;Milton and Ograbek, the children of serfs, added a note of encouragement by singing a military song: Go on, brave warrior!;['Milton', 'Ograbek'];['Milton', 'Ograbek']
72985;The Lady of the Lake;Pike, Okultich, Klaproth and Melfi, walked together like lice on a beggar and told silly jokes and anecdotes, which in their opinion were outrageously funny: '...;['Pike, Okultich', 'Klaproth'];['Klaproth']
72990;The Lady of the Lake;Some vehicles were loaded with food and Pike walked after them with his nose practically pressed to the ground, like a retriever, collecting anything that fell off the back â€“ a carrot here, a potato there and sometimes even some onions.;['Pike'];['Pike']
72992;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre was waiting for any chance or reason to separate from them.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
72993;The Lady of the Lake;He did not like Pike or Okultich.;['Pike', 'Okultich'];['Pike', 'Okultich']
73001;The Lady of the Lake;'Nice village,' Pike said.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73003;The Lady of the Lake;'Here in the valley,' Okultich hurried to explain, 'halflings have settled.;['Okultich'];['Okultich']
73006;The Lady of the Lake;'Non-humans are cursed,' snarled Klaproth.;['Klaproth'];['Klaproth']
73010;The Lady of the Lake;'For now,' Pike's lip curled back in an ugly grimace.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73014;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre turned his head.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73018;The Lady of the Lake;Ograbek and Milton started singing a new song.;['Milton'];['Milton']
73020;The Lady of the Lake;It could have been, after Pike's previous references, taken as an ominous sign.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73024;The Lady of the Lake;*** 'He,' Okultich said quietly, 'must have some money.;['Okultich'];['Okultich']
73026;The Lady of the Lake;The subject for whom Okultich had made the bet was a merchant who was travelling along the road, walking with a two wheeled wagon being pulled by a donkey.;['Okultich', 'two'];['Okultich']
73027;The Lady of the Lake;'Money calls money,' Pike lisped, 'and the little donkey would also be worth something.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73029;The Lady of the Lake;'Melfi,' Jarre pulled on the cooper's sleeve, 'open your eyes!;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73031;The Lady of the Lake;'These are just jokes, Jarre,' Melfi pulled away.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73037;The Lady of the Lake;'He's wearing a pretty decent outfit,' Okultich quietly appreciated.;['Okultich'];['Okultich']
73041;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre could not believe his courage, when he ran a few quick steps ahead of the gang, turned and stood between them and the merchant.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73044;The Lady of the Lake;Pike carelessly parted his long cloak and pointed at a knife on his belt, which was without a doubt sharp as a razor.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73046;The Lady of the Lake;Pike lisped with hatred.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73054;The Lady of the Lake;Although they behaved with ostentatious carelessness and did not reach towards their swords, Pike and Okultich immediately backed away and went limp and Klaproth looked like a deflated bladder.;['Pike and Okultich', 'Klaproth'];['Klaproth']
73055;The Lady of the Lake;'We... we're not...' stammered Pike.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73061;The Lady of the Lake;'We,' Jarre said quickly, 'are on our way to Vizima.;['Jarre', 'Vizima'];['Jarre']
73068;The Lady of the Lake;'In any case,' the other landsknecht measured Pike and his henchmen with penetrating eyes.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73076;The Lady of the Lake;His companion, Jarre and the merchant and his wagon and donkey followed him, and a short distance behind, Pike's mob.;['Jarre', 'Pike'];['Jarre', 'Pike']
73088;The Lady of the Lake;'I,' Jarre was quick to clarify, 'wish to enlist as a volunteer, not forced.';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73096;The Lady of the Lake;There awaiting them was a large group of travellers who had arrived before them, Jarre and his companions had to stop because the road was completely blocked by military troops.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73101;The Lady of the Lake;'Redania,' said Jarre.;['Redania', 'Jarre'];['Jarre']
73106;The Lady of the Lake;'It's about time,' Pike said from behind them with obvious sarcasm.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73121;The Lady of the Lake;These are the silver lilies, you blockhead...' 'Black field covered with silver lilies,' Jarre said, who wanted to show that he definitely climbed from no hole, and hurriedly explained â€“ 'The old coat of arms of the Kingdom of Temeria was a striding lion.;['Jarre', 'the Kingdom of \r\nTemeria'];['Jarre']
73124;The Lady of the Lake;'Fuckin know it all,' muttered Klaproth.;['Fuckin', 'Klaproth'];['Klaproth']
73129;The Lady of the Lake;'When prince Goidemar, son of old King Gardic went to fight Falka's evil insurgents, the army fought under this under the coat of arms of the lilies, making a decisive advantage.;['Goidemar', 'King Gardic', 'Falka'];['Goidemar', 'Falka']
73130;The Lady of the Lake;And when Goidemar inherited the throne from his father, in memory of those victories and the miraculous salvation of his wife and children from enemy hands, he instituted the coat of arms of three lilies on a black filed for his kingdom.;['Goidemar', 'three'];['Goidemar']
73131;The Lady of the Lake;And then King Cedric changed the official flag by special decree, so now it is a field strewn with silver lilies.;['Cedric'];['Cedric']
73135;The Lady of the Lake;'Not I,' said Jarre, 'but Jan of Attre, a scholar of heraldry.;['Jarre', 'Jan of Attre'];['Jarre']
73137;The Lady of the Lake;'Fucking great then,' said Pike in a low voice, 'that he is being recruited by the banner of the silver lilies, for the king of Temeria.';['Pike', 'Temeria'];['Pike']
73151;The Lady of the Lake;The same condottieri was present at the battle of Mayena- Adam Pangratt, Lorenzo Molla, Frontino and Julia Abatemarco where they decided to attack and broke the siege and liberated them from Nilfgaard's strength.';['condottieri', 'Adam Pangratt', 'Lorenzo Molla', 'Frontino', 'Julia Abatemarco', 'Nilfgaard'];['Adam', 'Lorenzo', 'Julia']

73166;The Lady of the Lake;'It is Julia Abatemarco who they call Pretty Kitty.;['Julia Abatemarco', 'Pretty Kitty'];['Julia']
73169;The Lady of the Lake;'I heard,' Pike said in a humble, yet disgustingly vitriolic tone, 'that famous victory was for nothing, that the gold coins used for their pay was wasted unnecessarily.;['Pike'];['Pike']
73179;The Lady of the Lake;the burly Klaproth said, opening his mouth widely.;['Klaproth'];['Klaproth']
73187;The Lady of the Lake;'I thought,' said Okultich, 'the dwarves fought against us.;['Okultich'];['Okultich']
73193;The Lady of the Lake;Those who march there are one of the dwarven regiments of infantry, sent to aid us by Brouver Hoog, Governor of Mahakam.;['Brouver Hoog', 'Mahakam'];['Brouver']

73226;The Lady of the Lake;Just choose one and...' 'Shut up,' growled Pike from between his teeth, smiling at the mercenaries, 'This one, gentlemen, is dying to serve in the cavalry.;['Shut', 'Pike'];['Pike']
73253;The Lady of the Lake;On the contrary, Jarre would have given his head, the closer to the city, the worse the smell got.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73262;The Lady of the Lake;As they left the darkness of the city gate, Jarre's eye fell upon a huge poster of a painted knight, who pointed his finger at him.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73269;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre turned around and suddenly realised they were alone â€“ the landsknecht, the merchant, and himself.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73270;The Lady of the Lake;Pike, Okultich, Klaproth, Melfi and the rural recruits were gone without a trace.;['Pike, Okultich', 'Klaproth'];['Klaproth']

73358;The Lady of the Lake;'What are you doing here Jarre?';['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73362;The Lady of the Lake;Dennis Cranmer, who had once served in the guard in the Principality of Ellander, enjoyed the reputation of being a dwarf who was difficult to deceive.;['Dennis Cranmer'];['Dennis']
73366;The Lady of the Lake;'Do you have permission from Nenneke?';['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']

73393;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre was not so sure.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']

73397;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre was afraid that one of the opponents would soon roll over the table and throw the wooden platter with pork, cooked peas and earthenware pints to the floor.;['Jarre', 'one'];['Jarre']
73399;The Lady of the Lake;'I don't understand, Dennis,' said another dwarf at the table called Sheldon Skaggs, without paying attention to the fact that one of the fighters after a hard blow almost rolled over his back.;['Dennis', 'Sheldon Skaggs'];['Dennis', 'Sheldon']
73408;The Lady of the Lake;'Let him to eat in peace, Sheldon.';['Sheldon'];['Sheldon']
73410;The Lady of the Lake;Jarre took a bite of pork with a spoonful of peas.;['Jarre'];['Jarre']
73414;The Lady of the Lake;'You can see for yourself,' Sheldon Skaggs looked at his companions, 'how much truth there is in the assertion that humans are a race closely akin to our own and that we derive from the same root, both them and us.;['Sheldon Skaggs'];['Sheldon']
73416;The Lady of the Lake;In other words, the same stupid enthusiasm we see in young dwarves.' 'Especially after Mayena,' said Zoltan Chivay calmly.;['Mayena', 'Zoltan Chivay'];['Zoltan']

73446;The Lady of the Lake;I remember the late volunteer army for the Marshal of Cintra, Vissegerd.;['Vissegerd'];['Vissegerd']
73453;The Lady of the Lake;'Shh,' said Dennis.;['Shh', 'Dennis'];['Dennis']

77665;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri wiped her face.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77669;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri stunned, watched the blood oozing from her leg.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77680;The Lady of the Lake;But I followed Geralt...;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77686;The Lady of the Lake;And I scoffed at Fringilla...;['Fringilla'];['Fringilla']
77699;The Lady of the Lake;Angouleme sighed, suddenly leaned forward and rested her forehead on Ciri's shoulder.;['Angouleme', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
77703;The Lady of the Lake;It took a long time before Ciri realised that she was holding a dead girl in her arms.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77716;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri felt overwhelmed by desperation.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77722;The Lady of the Lake;There will be someone old Leo Bonhart will find near the sorceress Yennefer.;['Leo \r\nBonhart', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77726;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri decided.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77731;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri quickened her pace.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77737;The Lady of the Lake;'Music, maestro!' Bonhart jumped and launched an attack, Ciri dodged with a pirouette, jumped and landed safely on her left leg and immediately struck.;['Music', 'Bonhart', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
77744;The Lady of the Lake;Unable to stop, and nearly off balance, Ciri was only saved by a lightning jump, but did not prevent the reach of Bonhart's sword to her shoulder.;['Ciri', 'Bonhart'];['Ciri']
77748;The Lady of the Lake;Like a Grim Reaper, Ciri had seen in a fresco in the temple.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77763;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri hesitated.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77770;The Lady of the Lake;This time Ciri was not fooled by his feints.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77777;The Lady of the Lake;And for Ciri that was enough.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77780;The Lady of the Lake;He immediately struck back with such force that if Ciri had not jumped back, the blow would have split her in half.;['Ciri', 'half'];['Ciri']
77788;The Lady of the Lake;But Ciri knew him to well.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77793;The Lady of the Lake;"His attacks were so continuous that Ciri could not jump or spin; she simply had to stop the blows and try to avoid them.";['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77805;The Lady of the Lake;'Yes, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77808;The Lady of the Lake;At the same time Ciri bounced and jumped to an adjacent beam.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77813;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri struck like lightning.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77824;The Lady of the Lake;For a moment he looked at Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77837;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri jumped.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77864;The Lady of the Lake;'I told you,' Ciri said coldly.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77871;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri stood over him.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
77881;The Lady of the Lake;'Watch out, Geralt!';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77887;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt, lying flat on the floor, his head cupped in his hands, was aware of how miserable a shield this was from the falling debris.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77889;The Lady of the Lake;He jumped up and could see the glow of a magical shield around him, he realised Yennefer's magic had saved him.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77890;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz threw a bolt of lightning at the other column behind which the sorceress was hiding.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77892;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer deftly slipped between them and retaliated with her own flash of lightning, which bounced off of the wizard with no visible effect.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77893;The Lady of the Lake;He answered with a crushing blow that knocked Yennefer to the ground.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77894;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt wiped the dust from his eyes and attacked.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77895;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz turned his eyes towards him and pointed his arm, and from his hands roared fire.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77898;The Lady of the Lake;'Ha!' roared Vilgefortz.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77904;The Lady of the Lake;This time he did not have Yennefer's protection.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77906;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer chanted spells and threw them at Vilgefortz one after another.;['Yennefer', 'Vilgefortz'];['Yennefer', 'Vilgefortz']
77909;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer wailed in pain and started rising from the ground.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77913;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt clenched his teeth in pain and rose to return to the fight.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77918;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer freed from the spell, fell with a scream of surprise into a pile of rubble, blood spurting from her mouth and down her chin and breasts.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77919;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt was already close.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77921;The Lady of the Lake;But Vilgefortz had no intention of surrendering.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77924;The Lady of the Lake;He materialised at Geralt's side.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77925;The Lady of the Lake;'Be careful,' the witcher grunted, trying to discern what was wrong with Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
77931;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz scream with rage and terror.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77938;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt also cried out, seeing that the wizard was literally tearing the vampire.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77947;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt cursed furiously and desperately.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77952;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz walked towards him.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77960;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt did not believe he could stand up.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77964;The Lady of the Lake;'In Thanedd,' said Vilgefortz, approaching him, twirling the rod, 'I settled for giving you a beating, in moderation, to serve as a lesson.;['Thanedd', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77968;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt did not try to escape.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77973;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt managed to parry the hammering blow.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77974;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz skilfully deflected.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77977;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt was fooled by a swing at his torso and a mock punch from the left â€“ the opposite end of the stick hit him n the ribs.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77983;The Lady of the Lake;"Geralt rolled; the rod drew sparks from the ground right next to his head.";['Geralt'];['Geralt']
77988;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt clenched his fist around Fringilla's medallion.;['Geralt', 'Fringilla'];['Geralt', 'Fringilla']
77991;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt rolled to the side and quickly got up on one knee.;['Geralt', 'one'];['Geralt']
77992;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz jumped after him and swung again.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
77999;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt quickly slashed him across the stomach.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78000;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz screamed, dropped the rod and took a few steps backwards.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78007;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt calmly waited with Sihil raised, ready to strike.;['Geralt', 'Sihil'];['Geralt']
78008;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz lifted his head and wailed shrilly.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78013;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer said, at last rising from the pile of rubble.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78016;The Lady of the Lake;'I didn't know,' she repeated, meeting Geralt's puzzled gaze, 'that you knew how to cast spells of illusion.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78017;The Lady of the Lake;And you were able to confuse Vilgefortz...';['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78021;The Lady of the Lake;But even so, we live thanks to Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78028;The Lady of the Lake;'Who was that, Geralt?' 'A friend.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78036;The Lady of the Lake;Without emotion he eyed Vilgefortz head, lying exactly in the middle of the floor of mosaics.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78047;The Lady of the Lake;'Ciri,' Yennefer said, supported by the witcher.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78048;The Lady of the Lake;'Geralt,' Ciri said.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
78058;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri walked, stiffly over to Yennefer.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
78059;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer smoothed her collar and tried to wipe the dried blood from her sleeve.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78063;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt saw the sorceress's hands on Ciri's back.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78068;The Lady of the Lake;'Mummy.' 'My daughter.' 'Let's go,' Geralt decided to interrupt, but only after a long time.;['Mummy', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
78070;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer scolded her with a look and rubbed one of her eyes.;['Yennefer', 'one'];['Yennefer']
78072;The Lady of the Lake;The witcher watched the corridor from which Ciri emerged, as if expecting someone else to come from there.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78076;The Lady of the Lake;'Yes,' said Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78078;The Lady of the Lake;'I'll never leave you again,' Ciri said dully.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78079;The Lady of the Lake;'Never again.' 'Let's go,' said Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78090;The Lady of the Lake;'Me too,' said Geralt as he drew Sihil.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78099;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri looked at Yennefer, who if not for the railing she was leaning against, would have fallen down.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
78101;The Lady of the Lake;The cat she hung around her neck, the wolf she gave to Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78105;The Lady of the Lake;'Come on, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78111;The Lady of the Lake;'Slowly, Ciri, don't rush.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78113;The Lady of the Lake;'I know, Geralt.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78128;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt stepped forward, feinted at one, and cut another's throat.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78129;The Lady of the Lake;He spun and Ciri dashed under his right arm.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78133;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt wiped a few drops of blood from his face.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78134;The Lady of the Lake;'Calmly, Ciri.';['Calmly', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
78141;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri, with a quick step, deflected the spear and Geralt slashed at the man.;['Ciri', 'Geralt'];['Ciri', 'Geralt']
78150;The Lady of the Lake;'Excellent, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78159;The Lady of the Lake;'Excellent, Ciri.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78173;The Lady of the Lake;Stefan Skellen shouted from below.;['Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']
78175;The Lady of the Lake;Boreas Mun was supposed to bring crossbows!;['Boreas Mun'];['Boreas']
78177;The Lady of the Lake;Boreas Mun â€“ the Owl could not know â€“ was already quite far away.;['Boreas Mun'];['Boreas']
78189;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt immediately covered Ciri with his body, but the girl slipped past him and as the rope from the crossbow twanged, she was already in position.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
78191;The Lady of the Lake;'Very good,' Geralt muttered.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78192;The Lady of the Lake;'Very good, Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78216;The Lady of the Lake;Men, to arms!' Geralt looked at Cir and almost screamed with rage when he noticed silver threads among her grey hair.;['Geralt', 'Cir'];['Geralt']
78225;The Lady of the Lake;'I'm here with you,' said Yennefer, walking down behind them on the slippery stairs.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78237;The Lady of the Lake;'The miraculous rescue,' Ciri said in a whisper.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78238;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt shook his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78245;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt felt the warmth from Ciri's arm and could hear her breathing.;['Geralt', 'Ciri'];['Geralt', 'Ciri']
78246;The Lady of the Lake;Above, avoiding the corpses and spilled blood, came Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78247;The Lady of the Lake;She showed the soldiers her empty hands and sat down heavily on the step next to Geralt and Ciri.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78257;The Lady of the Lake;'Stefan Skellen,' the officer said in a voice that rang metallically around the vaulted room.;['Stefan Skellen'];['Stefan']
78264;The Lady of the Lake;Now it's our turn, thought Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78266;The Lady of the Lake;The officer stared at Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78273;The Lady of the Lake;'Vilgefortz?';['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78275;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt shook his head.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78283;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt did not respond.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78285;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer again scolded her with her eyes.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78293;The Lady of the Lake;'Find us a discrete chamber, where I can rest and talk undisturbed with Geralt of Rivia.;['Geralt of Rivia'];['Geralt']
78296;The Lady of the Lake;'As you wish, Your Majesty!' 'Geralt, follow me, please.';['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78298;The Lady of the Lake;He looked at Ciri and Yennefer, wanting to calm them, wanting to warning them not to try any nonsense.;['Ciri', 'Yennefer'];['Ciri', 'Yennefer']
78301;The Lady of the Lake;*** 'You have come a long way,' repeated Emhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd, the White Flam Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies.;['Emhyr var Emreis', 'Deithwen Addan', 'Carn', 'Morvudd', 'the White Flam Dancing', 'Enemies'];['Emhyr']
78302;The Lady of the Lake;I don't know,' Geralt said calmly, 'yours appears to have been longer, Duny.';['Geralt', 'Duny'];['Geralt']
78310;The Lady of the Lake;Not without outside help and guidance, I guessed what role you were to play in family incest with Ciri.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78313;The Lady of the Lake;'You can hardly keep your feet,' Emhyr said coldly.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78318;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt, with relief, sat.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78319;The Lady of the Lake;Emhyr stood leaning against a carved cabinet.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78324;The Lady of the Lake;'Cirilla,' Emhyr said ignoring the sarcasm, 'is going to Nilfgaard.;['Cirilla', 'Emhyr', 'Nilfgaard'];['Cirilla', 'Emhyr']
78329;The Lady of the Lake;Cirilla is not the first.';['Cirilla', 'first'];['Cirilla']
78330;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt declined to comment.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78331;The Lady of the Lake;'Cirilla,' continued the Emperor, 'will be happy, like most of the queens I just spoke about.;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
78333;The Lady of the Lake;I will not demand love from her but will transfer it to the son that Cirilla will bear for me.;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
78339;The Lady of the Lake;'It is clear that Cirilla must never know who I really am.;['Cirilla'];['Cirilla']
78341;The Lady of the Lake;Along with those who know it.' 'Sure' Geralt nodded.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78343;The Lady of the Lake;'You cannot help noticing,' Emhyr said after a moment, 'the hand of fate in everything that has happened.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78346;The Lady of the Lake;From the very beginning.' 'Rather, I see the hand of Vilgefortz.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78349;The Lady of the Lake;It was he who made Pavetta...';['Pavetta'];['Pavetta']
78350;The Lady of the Lake;'You are shooting in the dark,' Emhyr interrupted abruptly, throwing his salamander cloak over his shoulder.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78358;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt interrupted.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78374;The Lady of the Lake;Now it is your turn, you have Ciri, your own daughter, who you once shamefully deprived of parents and with whom you now want to shamelessly spawn incestuous offspring.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78383;The Lady of the Lake;'You are weak,' Emhyr var Emreis said gently.;['Emhyr var Emreis'];['Emhyr']
78387;The Lady of the Lake;'The Iron Hedgehog,' Emhyr var Emreis said calmly and quietly, 'was a way of forcing my father to cooperate with the usurper to the throne.;['Emhyr var Emreis'];['Emhyr']
78389;The Lady of the Lake;"He did not break; however, because the usurping Duke devised something else â€“ before his eyes, he had a hired sorcerer turn his only son into a monster.";['Duke'];['Duke']
78391;The Lady of the Lake;In our language, Emhyr means hedgehog.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78398;The Lady of the Lake;A crackpot astrologer called Xarthisius had read in the stars that the cure to the spell could be found in the North, beyond the Marnadal Steps.;['Xarthisius', 'North', 'Marnadal Steps'];['Xarthisius']
78402;The Lady of the Lake;The truth is that Vilgefortz had nothing to do with it.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78408;The Lady of the Lake;"The sorcerer's name was Braathens, which in our language is the same as the word ""fried"".";['Braathens'];['Braathens']
78420;The Lady of the Lake;'Of course.' 'Meanwhile, in Nilfgaard,' Emhyr ignored Geralt's comment, 'my business was on track.;['Nilfgaard', 'Geralt'];['Geralt']
78438;The Lady of the Lake;It was clear, I had to go back to Nilfgaard, but in a way that no one would know that I was Duny and that Ciri was my daughter.;['Nilfgaard', 'Duny', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
78439;The Lady of the Lake;Vilgefortz suggested a way.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78440;The Lady of the Lake;Duny, Pavetta and their child were to die, disappear without a trace...';['Pavetta'];['Pavetta']
78443;The Lady of the Lake;While sailing from Skellige to Cintra we had been driven by magic to the Sedna Abyss, where Vilgefortz pulled our boat into the maelstrom.;['Skellige', 'Cintra', 'Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78444;The Lady of the Lake;I, Pavetta and Ciri would be close in a specially protected cabin and survive.;['Pavetta', 'Ciri'];['Pavetta', 'Ciri']
78448;The Lady of the Lake;'When it became clear that Ciri was not on board.';['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78449;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt raised his eyebrows.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78451;The Lady of the Lake;'I underestimated Pavetta in my plans.;['Pavetta'];['Pavetta']
78458;The Lady of the Lake;Before I could jump in behind her, Vilgefortz pulled the ship into the maelstrom.;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78464;The Lady of the Lake;'Worse than a mangy dog,' Emhyr replied promptly.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78470;The Lady of the Lake;Pavetta died accidentally.';['Pavetta'];['Pavetta']
78471;The Lady of the Lake;'You're lying,' Geralt said dryly, 'and it does not become an Emperor.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78472;The Lady of the Lake;Pavetta could not live.;['Pavetta'];['Pavetta']
78475;The Lady of the Lake;'She would have lived,' Emhyr contradicted him.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78482;The Lady of the Lake;Emhyr avoided his gaze.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78483;The Lady of the Lake;'Just what I thought,' Geralt nodded.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78488;The Lady of the Lake;My relationship with Vilgefortz had cooled considerably, and I still held a grudge against other sorcerers...;['Vilgefortz'];['Vilgefortz']
78492;The Lady of the Lake;I would take in one fell swoop, Cintra and Ciri.;['Cintra', 'Ciri'];['Ciri']
78494;The Lady of the Lake;'Yes, I know,' said Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78500;The Lady of the Lake;"They did not even know her, except for Cahir; none of them had seen her.";['Cahir'];['Cahir']
78515;The Lady of the Lake;'You can spare Yennefer's life.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78517;The Lady of the Lake;'She,' Emhyr said seriously, 'would pay any price to take my Ciri.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78527;The Lady of the Lake;Emhyr stood up, walked to the window and stared out the dark portal.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78529;The Lady of the Lake;"But...' 'Do not worry; I won't say anything to Ciri.";['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78532;The Lady of the Lake;After a long silence, Emhyr turned from the window.;['Emhyr'];['Emhyr']
78537;The Lady of the Lake;'Do you believe,' the Emperor said quietly, 'that the Lady Yennefer would accompany you in the tub?';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78542;The Lady of the Lake;*** Yennefer agreed without hesitation.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78545;The Lady of the Lake;*** 'I don't understand,' Ciri spluttered like an angry cat, 'I don't see why I should go with him!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78548;The Lady of the Lake;'My daughter,' Yennefer said quietly.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78551;The Lady of the Lake;'And you?' 'Us,' Yennefer looked at Geralt, 'a different destiny awaits us.;['Us', 'Yennefer', 'Geralt'];['Yennefer', 'Geralt']

78563;The Lady of the Lake;He heard Yennefer sigh.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78569;The Lady of the Lake;'You,' Ciri said, directing an angry look at Emhyr.;['Ciri', 'Emhyr'];['Ciri', 'Emhyr']
78572;The Lady of the Lake;Emhyr var Emreis did not respond.;['Emhyr var Emreis'];['Emhyr']
78591;The Lady of the Lake;'This will happen,' he drawled, not taking his eyes from Ciri, 'as intended.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
78593;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri looked at the witcher, Geralt made a dismissive motion with his head.;['Ciri', 'Geralt'];['Ciri', 'Geralt']
78595;The Lady of the Lake;She hugged Yennefer and whispered together for a long time.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
78596;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri then approached Geralt.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78609;The Lady of the Lake;You know, Geralt, I've had enough of killing.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
78615;The Lady of the Lake;*** Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard escorted the witcher and the sorceress to the bath chamber, to a large marble bathtub filled with warm, fragrant water.;['Emhyr var Emreis', 'Nilfgaard'];['Emhyr']

81445;The Lady of the Lake;'I am still a member of the Lodge,' said Yennefer.;['Lodge', 'Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
81449;The Lady of the Lake;'Your insolence,' Sabrina said, lacing her fingers together, loaded with onyx rings, 'borders on bad taste, Yennefer.';['Sabrina', 'Yennefer'];['Sabrina', 'Yennefer']

82189;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie just jumped, the hooves of the horse knocking off a few hats and caps.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
82192;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer, as she rode, saw bodies lying in gutters and noticed bodies hanging by their legs from posts and beams.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82198;The Lady of the Lake;The next obstacle was a group of halberdiers, who tried to fence the black mare in before Kelpie jumped over them.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
82201;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer realised that Ciri, undoubtedly guided by a prophetic vision, was heading to the heat of the incident.;['Yennefer', 'Ciri'];['Yennefer', 'Ciri']
82204;The Lady of the Lake;Ciri screamed and clung to the neck of her mare.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
82205;The Lady of the Lake;Kelpie rose into the air and jumped over the barricade, not like a horse, but lie a huge black bird.;['Kelpie'];['Kelpie']
82206;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer rain into the crowd, but pulled her horse up short, knocking over several people.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82210;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer had had enough of being kicked.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82216;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer shot flames into his face, his eyeballs boiled and them burst, running down his cheeks with a hiss.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82217;The Lady of the Lake;She relaxed, someone grabbed her by the arm, and Yennefer pulled ready to shot, but it was Triss.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82219;The Lady of the Lake;I've already heard that voice, Yennefer thought.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82228;The Lady of the Lake;The fingers that Triss dug into her arm were like steel, Yennefer liberated herself from the grip with a great effort.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82233;The Lady of the Lake;I will not leave Ciri alone!;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
82234;The Lady of the Lake;Or Geralt!;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
82238;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer shook her head, ruffling her black curls.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82264;The Lady of the Lake;'It did not work,' Tissaia de Vries said, sitting next to the bed.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
82265;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer wanted a drink, something to wet her sticky lips.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82268;The Lady of the Lake;'It did not work,' said Tissaia de Vries.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
82275;The Lady of the Lake;Seriously.' Yennefer numbly stared at the ceiling.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82282;The Lady of the Lake;And the hands of a sorceress are a very important instrument, Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82285;The Lady of the Lake;'You'll live,' said Tissaia factually, seriously, even severe.;['Tissaia'];['Tissaia']
82288;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer eagerly suck moisture from a stick wrapped in a wet dressing.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82289;The Lady of the Lake;'I'll take care of you,' echoed Tissaia de Vries, touching her hair gently.;['Tissaia de Vries'];['Tissaia']
82300;The Lady of the Lake;Someone had dragged her across the ground, it was Triss, she was met by the smell of her perfume.;['Triss'];['Triss']
82302;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer saw a rider in full armour, with a white shield with a red chevron, from the height of his saddle he was whipping the crowd.;['Yennefer', 'chevron'];['Yennefer']
82305;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer felt that instead of an upper lip, she had a big potato.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82309;The Lady of the Lake;'No, Yennefer,' Triss's voice was very quiet and very cold.;['Yennefer', 'Triss'];['Yennefer', 'Triss']

82327;The Lady of the Lake;But okay, Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']
82335;The Lady of the Lake;It won't work, thought Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82338;The Lady of the Lake;It was said that Alzur had a voice like a bell and superior diction.;['Alzur'];['Alzur']
82345;The Lady of the Lake;'Oh,' said Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

82359;The Lady of the Lake;'If anyone was there with Triss,' said the Lady of the Lake, 'they did not survive the vision of the artist.';['Triss'];['Triss']
82360;The Lady of the Lake;*** 'It seems that you did it,' said Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82367;The Lady of the Lake;Hail rattled on the magical shield that Yennefer was able to throw up at the last minute above both sorceresses and threatened to break through.;['Hail', 'Yennefer', 'the last minute'];['Yennefer']
82378;The Lady of the Lake;They were still falling, but the biggest downpour had abated, Yennefer could tell by the pounding on the magical shield, then the hail stopped.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82382;The Lady of the Lake;'Bravo, Triss,' croaked Yennefer.;['Triss', 'Yennefer'];['Triss', 'Yennefer']
82387;The Lady of the Lake;We better run, Triss.;['Triss'];['Triss']

82402;The Lady of the Lake;*** Geralt lay senseless, white as chalk.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
82404;The Lady of the Lake;He began to shake and to tremble so violently that Ciri could not hold him.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
82405;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer knelt beside him.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82410;The Lady of the Lake;'It won't work,' said Ciri's voice, radiating despair.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
82411;The Lady of the Lake;'Your magic cannot cure him, Yennefer.';['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82412;The Lady of the Lake;'We arrived...' Yennefer could barely move her lips.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82416;The Lady of the Lake;You're right, Ciri, Triss thought, feeling something catch in her throat.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
82421;The Lady of the Lake;'it is too late for a doctor,' Triss said, surprising herself that her voice sounded so calm.;['Triss'];['Triss']
82423;The Lady of the Lake;Geralt continued to stir, coughing blood, then becoming very tense and froze.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
82424;The Lady of the Lake;Dandelion, still holding Triss, sighed in despair, the dwarf cursed.;['Triss'];['Triss']
82425;The Lady of the Lake;Yennefer moaned, her face changing suddenly, contracted and ugly.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82426;The Lady of the Lake;'There is nothing more pathetic,' said Ciri sternly, 'than a sorceress in tears.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']
82428;The Lady of the Lake;But now you're pathetic Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82429;The Lady of the Lake;You and your magic, which is useless.' Yennefer did not reply.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82430;The Lady of the Lake;She could barely hold Geralt's head in both of her hands, while repeating a spell.;['Geralt'];['Geralt']
82436;The Lady of the Lake;The spell only exhausted Yennefer.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82437;The Lady of the Lake;Triss was surprised that the black-haired sorceress was able to withstand for so long.;['Triss'];['Triss']
82438;The Lady of the Lake;Then she ceased to be surprised because Yennefer stopped in the middle of the magic formula and fell on the pavement next to the witcher.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82444;The Lady of the Lake;'I,' Ciri said slowly, still kneeling on the bloody ground, 'I once gave up my power.;['Ciri'];['Ciri']

82461;The Lady of the Lake;'Ihuarraquax,' Ciri spoke to him.;['Ihuarraquax', 'Ciri'];['Ihuarraquax', 'Ciri']

82674;Something Ends, Something Begins;The sun pushed its fiery tentacles through the cracks of the window shutters, sliced the chamber with slanted streaks of light, pulsing in the hovering dust, spilled in bright spots on the floor and the bear skins covering it, and shattered in a blinding flash on the buckle of Yennefer's belt.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']
82675;Something Ends, Something Begins;Yennefer's belt lay on a high-heeled shoe, the high-heeled shoe lay on a white lace shirt, and the white shirt lay on a black skirt.;['Yennefer'];['Yennefer']

82862;Something Ends, Something Begins;The situation was saved by the dragon Villentretenmerth, still in the form of Borch Three Jackdaws, who calmly explained to the doppler that being able to change forms is a privilege, which, however, also obligates the changeling to always acquire a form that is acceptable to society, and that is nothing else than a mere politeness towards the host.;['Villentretenmerth', 'Borch Three Jackdaws'];['Villentretenmerth']

82885;Something Ends, Something Begins;Around midnight, a vampire flew in through an open window, but was chased off by the dwarf Yarpen Zigrin, who was throwing garlic at him, trying to hit.;['Around midnight', 'Yarpen Zigrin'];['Yarpen']
82886;Something Ends, Something Begins;Throughout the whole evening something howled, rang with chains and moaned, but no one took notice of that, because everyone thought that it was Dandelion and the strongly rarefied group of his still relatively sober friends.;['Dandelion'];['Dandelion']
82888;Something Ends, Something Begins;The threshold of tolerance was crossed by a fuzzy phantom with fiery eyes, who mischievously pinched at Sh'eenaz's butt.;"[""Sh'eenaz""]";"[""Sh'eenaz""]"

82920;Something Ends, Something Begins;So it ended with Nenneke hunting anyone she could into work.;['Nenneke'];['Nenneke']
82922;Something Ends, Something Begins;However, Nenneke found an unexpected help in the person of Gardenia Biberveldt and the hobbits from her company.;['Nenneke', 'Gardenia'];['Nenneke', 'Gardenia']
